        <h2>1. Introduction to Gravity</h2>
        <p>Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of nature. It is the force that attracts two objects with mass toward each other. The more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull.</p>
        
        <p>Sir Isaac Newton was the first to formulate the theory of gravity in his work "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" published in 1687. His theory remained the definitive description of gravity until Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity in the early 20th century.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Historical Note:</strong> Legend has it that Newton was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity when he saw an apple fall from a tree. While this story may be apocryphal, it illustrates how everyday observations can lead to profound scientific discoveries.

        <h2>2. Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation</h2>
        <p>Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.</p>
        
        <div class="formula">
            F = G × (m₁ × m₂) / r²

        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>F</strong> is the gravitational force between the masses</li>
            <li><strong>G</strong> is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)</li>
            <li><strong>m₁</strong> and <strong>m₂</strong> are the masses of the objects</li>
            <li><strong>r</strong> is the distance between the centers of the masses</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.1 Characteristics of Gravitational Force</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is always attractive in nature</li>
            <li>It is a central force, acting along the line joining the centers of two masses</li>
            <li>It is a conservative force, meaning work done by gravity is independent of the path taken</li>
            <li>It follows the inverse square law</li>

        <h2>3. Acceleration Due to Gravity</h2>
        <p>The acceleration due to gravity (g) is the acceleration experienced by an object due to the gravitational force. Near the Earth's surface, this acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s² directed toward the center of the Earth.</p>
        
        <div class="formula">

            <li><strong>r</strong> is the distance from the center of the Earth</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.1 Variation of g with Altitude</h3>
        <p>The value of g decreases with increasing altitude because the distance from the Earth's center increases.</p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Variation of g with Depth</h3>
        <p>When moving below the Earth's surface, g decreases linearly with depth, becoming zero at the center of the Earth.</p>

            U = m × g × h

            <li><strong>h</strong> is the height above a reference point</li>

        <p>This formula is valid near the Earth's surface where g is approximately constant. For larger distances, the more general formula is:</p>

            U = -G × (m₁ × m₂) / r

        <h2>7. Weight and Weightlessness</h2>
        <p>Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity. It is calculated as:</p>
        
        <div class="formula">
            W = m × g
        </div>
        
        <p>Where W is the weight, m is the mass, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.</p>
        
        <p>Weightlessness is a condition in which an object or person appears to be free from the effects of gravity. It occurs when an object is in free fall or in orbit. In these situations, the object is still under the influence of gravity but does not feel its effects because it is in a state of continuous free fall.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Astronauts in the International Space Station experience weightlessness not because they are beyond the reach of Earth's gravity, but because they are in a continuous state of free fall around the Earth.

                <p>
                    Near Earth's surface, gravity produces a constant acceleration of approximately 
                    9.8 m/s² (denoted as 'g'). This value varies slightly depending on:

                    <li>Altitude (decreases with height)</li>
                    <li>Latitude (slightly less at the equator due to Earth's rotation)</li>

                    <p>
                        Calculate the gravitational force between two spheres of mass 10 kg each, 
                        separated by a distance of 1 meter.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Solution:</h3>
                    <p>Given: m₁ = m₂ = 10 kg, r = 1 m, G = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N⋅m²/kg²</p>
                    <p>
                        F = G × (m₁ × m₂) / r²<br>
                        F = (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹) × (10 × 10) / (1)²<br>
                        F = 6.674 × 10⁻⁹ N
