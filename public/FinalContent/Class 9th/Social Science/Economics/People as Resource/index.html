By viewing people as human capital, we can understand their role in contributing to national income and development. Just like investment in physical capital, investment in education, skills, and healthcare increases productivity and creates greater opportunities. This chapter encourages us to see the positive side of a large population and the importance of human capital formation for a nation's growth.</p>

                    <p> The chapter 'People as Resource' is an
 effort to explain population as an asset
 for the economy rather than a liability.
 Population becomes human capital when
 there is investment made in the form of
 education, training and medical care.
 In fact, human capital is the stock of
 skill and productive knowledge embodied
 in them.
 'People as Resource' is a way of
 referring to a country's working people
 in terms of their existing productive
 skills and abilities. Looking at the
 population from this productive aspect
 emphasises its ability to contribute to
 the creation of the Gross National
 Product. Like other resources population
 also is a resource ‚Äî a 'human resource'.
 

This is the positive side of a large
 population that is often overlooked when
 we look only at the negative side,
 considering only the problems of
 providing the population with food,
 education and access to health facilities.
 When the existing 'human resource' is
 further developed by becoming more
 educated and healthy, we call it 'human
 capital formation' that adds to the
 productive power of the country just like
 'physical capital formation'.
 Investment in human capital
 (through education, training, medical
 care) yields a return just like investment
 in physical capital. This can be seen
 directly in the form of higher incomes
 earned because of higher productivity
 of the more educated or the better trained
 persons, as well as the higher
 productivity of healthier people.

 India's Green Revolution is a
 dramatic example of how the input
 of greater knowledge in the form of
 improved production technologies can
 rapidly increase the productivity of
 scarce land resources. India's IT
 revolution is a striking instance of
 how the importance of human capital
 has come to acquire a higher position
 than that of material, plant and
 machinery.  Not only do the more educated and the
 healthier people gain through higher
 incomes, society also gains in other
 indirect ways because the advantages of a
 more educated or a healthier population
 spreads to those also who themselves were
 not directly educated or given health care.
 In fact, human capital is in one way
 superior to other resources like land and
 physical capital: human resource can
 make use of land and capital. Land and
 capital cannot become useful on its own!
 For many decades in India, a large
 population has been considered a liability
 rather than an asset. But a large  population need not be a burden for the
 economy. It can be turned into a
 productive asset by investment in human
 capital (for example, by spending
 resources on education and health for all,
 training of industrial and agricultural
 workers in the use of modern technology,
 useful scientific researches and so on).
 The two following cases illustrate how
 people can try to become a more productive
 resource:</p>

                            <p>There were two friends Vilas and
 Sakal living in the same village
 Semapur. Sakal was a twelve-year
old boy. His mother Sheela looked
 after domestic chores. His father Buta
 Chaudhary worked in an agricultural
 field. Sakal helped his mother in
 domestic chores. He also looked after
 his younger brother Jeetu and sister
 Seetu. His uncle Shyam had passed
 the matriculation examination, but,
 was sitting idle in the house as he
 had no job. Buta and Sheela were
 eager to teach Sakal. They forced him
 to join the village school which he
 soon joined. He started studying and
 completed his higher secondary
 examination. His father persuaded
 him to continue his studies. He raised
 a loan for Sakal to study a vocational
 course in computers. Sakal was
 meritorious and interested in studies
 from the beginning. With great vigour
 and enthusiasm he completed his
 course. After some time he got a job
 in a private firm. He even designed a
 new kind of software. This software
 helped him increase the sale of the
 firm. His boss acknowledged his
 services and rewarded him with a
 promotion.</p>

                            <p>Vilas was an eleven-year old boy
 residing in the same village as Sakal.
 Vilas's father Mahesh was a
 fisherman. His father passed away
 when he was only two years old. His
 mother Geeta sold fish to earn money
 to feed the family. She bought fish
 from the landowner's pond and sold
 it in the nearby mandi. She could
 earn only Rs 150 a day by selling fish.
 Vilas became a patient of arthritis.
 His mother could not afford to take
 him to the doctor. He could not go to
 school either. He was not interested
 in studies. He helped his mother in
 cooking and also looked after his
 younger brother Mohan. After some
 time his mother fell sick and there
 was no one to look after her. There
 was no one in the family to support
 them. Vilas, too, was forced to sell
 fish in the same village. He like his
 mother earned only a meagre
 income.</p>

                            <p>In the two case studies we saw Sakal
 went to school and Vilas did not go. Sakal
 was physically strong and healthy. There
 was no need for him to visit the doctor
 frequently. Vilas was a patient of
 arthritis. He lacked the means to visit
 the doctor. Sakal acquired a degree in
 computer programming. Sakal found a
 job in a private firm while Vilas
 continued with the same work as his
 mother. He earned a meagre income like
 his mother to support a family.
 In the case of Sakal, several years of
 education added to the quality of labour.
 This enhanced his total productivity.
 Total productivity adds to the growth of
 the economy. This in turn pays an  individual through salary or in some other
 form of his choice. In case of Vilas, there
 could not be any education or health care
 in the early part of his life. He spends
 his life selling fish like his mother.
 Henceforth, he draws the same salary of
 unskilled labourer as his mother.
 Investment in human resource (via
 education and medical care) can give high
 rates of return in future. This investment
 on people is the same as investment in
 land and capital.
 A child, too, with investments made
 on her education and health, can yield
 a high return in future in the form of
 higher earnings and greater
 contribution to the society. Educated
 parents are found to invest more heavily
 on the education of their child. This is
 because they have realised the
 importance of education for themselves.
 They are also conscious of proper
 nutrition and hygiene. They accordingly
 look after their children's needs for
 education at school and good health. A
 virtuous cycle is, thus, created in this
 case. In contrast, a vicious cycle may
 be created by disadvantaged parents,
 who themselves uneducated and lacking
 in hygiene, keep their children in a
 similarly disadvantaged state.
 Countries, like Japan, have invested
 in human resource. They did not have any
 natural resource. These countries are
 developed/rich. They import the natural
 resource needed in their country. How did
 they become rich/developed? They have
 invested on people, especially in the field
 of education and health. These people
 have made efficient use of other resources,
 like land and capital. Efficiency and the
 technology evolved by people have made
 these countries rich/developed.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Like Vilas and Sakal, people have been
 engaged in various activities. We saw that
 Vilas sold fish and Sakal got a job in the
 firm. The various activities have been
 classified into three main sectors i.e.,
 primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary
 sector includes agriculture, forestry,
 animal husbandry, fishing, poultry
 farming, mining and quarrying.
 Manufacturing is included in the
 secondary sector. Trade, transport,
 communication, banking, education,
 health, tourism, services, insurance, etc.
 are included in the tertiary sector. The
 activities in this sector result in the
 production of goods and services. These
 activities add value to the national
 income. These activities are called
 economic activities. Economic activities
 have two parts ‚Äî market activities and
 non-market activities. Market activities
 involve remuneration to anyone who
 performs i.e., activity performed for pay
 or profit. These include production of goods
 or services, including government service.
 Non-market activities are the production
 for self-consumption.</p> 
 
 <p>These can be consumption and processing of primary
 product and own account production of
 fixed assets.  Due to historical and cultural reasons
 there is a division of labour between men
 and women in the family. Women
 generally look after domestic chores and
 men work in the fields. Sakal's mother
 Sheela cooks food, cleans utensils, washes
 clothes, cleans the house and looks after
 her children. Sakal's father Buta
 cultivates the field, sells the produce in
 the market and earns money for the family.
 Sheela is not paid for the services
 delivered for upbringing of the family.
 Buta earns money, which he spends on
 rearing his family. Women are not paid
 for their service delivered in the family.
 The household work done by women is
 not recognised in the National Income.
 Geeta, mother of Vilas, earned an
 income by selling fish. Thus women are
 paid for their work when they enter the
 labour market. Their earning like that of
 their male counterpart is determined on
 the basis of education and skill.</p> 
 
 <p>Education helps individual to make better
 use of the economic opportunities
 available before him. Education and skill
 are the major determinants of the earning
 of any individual in the market. A majority
 of women have meagre education and low
 skill formation. Women are paid low
 compared to men. Most women work
 where job security is not there. Various
 activities relating to legal protection is
 meagre. Employment in this sector is
 characterised by irregular and low
 income. In this sector there is an absence
 of basic facilities like maternity leave,
 childcare and other social security
 systems. However, women with high
 education and skill formation are paid at
 par with the men. Among the organised
 sector, teaching and medicine attract
 them the most. Some women have entered
 administrative and other services
 including job, that need high levels of
 scientific and technological competence.

                            <p> Sakal's education in the initial years of
 his life bore him the fruits in the later
 years in terms of a good job and salary.
 We saw education was an important  input
 for the growth of Sakal. It opened new
 horizon for him, provided new aspiration
 and developed values of life. Not only for
 Sakal, education contributes towards the
 growth of society also. It enhances the  national income, cultural richness and
 increases the efficiency of governance.
 There is a provision made for providing
 universal access, retention and quality in  elementary education with a special
 emphasis on girls. There is also an
 establishment of pace setting of schools
 like Navodaya Vidyalaya in each district.
 Vocational streams have been developed
 to equip large number of high school
 students with occupations related to
 knowledge and skills. The plan outlay on
 education has increased from Rs 151 crore
 in the first plan to Rs 99,300 crore in
 2020‚Äì21. The expenditure on education as
 a percentage of GDP rose from 0.64% in
 1951‚Äì52 to 3.1% in 2019‚Äì20 (B.E.)  and
 has remained stagnant around 3% from
 past few years. The Budgetary Estimate  as stated in the Budget Documents of
 Union State Governments, Reserve Bank
 of India, the expenditure on education as a
 percentage of GDP has  declined to 2.8% in
 2020‚Äì21 (B.E.) The literacy rates have
 increased from 18% in 1951 to 85% in 2018.
 Literacy is not only a right, it is also needed
 if the citizens are to perform their duties
 and enjoy their rights properly. However, a
 vast difference is noticed across different
 sections of the population. Literacy among
 males is nearly 16.1% higher than females
 and it is about 14.2% higher in urban areas
 as compared to rural areas. As per 2011
 census, literacy rates varied from 94% in
 Kerala to 62% in Bihar. The primary school
 system (I‚ÄìV) has expanded to over 7,78,842
 lakh in 2019‚Äì20. Unfortunately, this huge
 expansion of schools has been diluted by  the poor quality of schooling and high
 dropout rates. Samagra Shiksha is a
 significant step for the school education
 sector extending from pre-school to Class
 XII, with the broader goal of improving school
 effectiveness measured in terms of equal
 opportunities for schooling and equitable
 learning outcomes. The scheme envisages
 the 'school' as the continuum from
 pre-school, primary, middle to secondary
 levels and attempts to ensure inclusive and
 equitable quality education from pre-school
 to secondary stage in accordance with the
 Sustainable Develompent Goals. Mid-day
 meal scheme has been implemented to
 encourage attendance and retention of
 children and improve their nutritional
 status. These policies could add to the
 literate population of India.
 The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in
 higher education in the age group of 18 to
 23 years is 27% in 2020‚Äì21, which
 would be broadly in line with world
 average. The strategy focuses on
 increasing  access, quality, adoption of
 state-specific curriculum modification,
 vocationalisation and networking on the
 use of information technology. There is
 also focus on distance education,
 convergence of formal, non-formal,
 distance and IT education institutions. Over the past 60 years, there has been a
 significant growth in the number of
 university and institutions of higher
 learning in specialised areas. Let us read
 the table to see the increase in the
 number of college, universities, enrolment
 of students and recruitment of teachers
 from 1951 to 2019‚Äì20.</p>

                            <p> Firm maximise profit: Do you think any
 firm would be induced to employ people
 who might not work efficiently as healthy
 workers because of ill health?
 The health of a person helps him to
 realise his/her potential and the ability
 to fight illness. He/She will not be able to maximise his/her output to the overall
 growth of the organisation. Indeed; health
 is an indispensable basis for realising one's
 well-being. Henceforth, improvement in
 the health status of the population has
 been the priority of the country. Our
 national policy, too, aims at improving the
 accessibility of healthcare, family welfare
 and nutritional service with a special
 focus on the underprivileged segment of
 the population. Over the last five decades,
 India has built a vast healt infrastructure
 and has also developed the manpower
 required at primary, secondary and
 tertiary sector in government, as well as,
 in the private sector.
 These measures, which have been
 adopted, have increased the life
 expectancy to over 67.2 years in 2021.
 Infant mortality rate (IMR) has come
 down from 147 in 1951 to 28 in 2020.
 Crude birth rates have dropped to
 20.0 (2020) and death rates to 6
 (2020) within the same duration of
 time. Increase in life expectancy and
 improvement in childcare are useful
 in assessing the future progress of the
 country. Increase in longevity of life is
 an indicator of good quality of life
 marked by self-confidence. Reduction
 in infant mortality involves the
 protection of children from infection,
 ensuring the nutrition of both the
 mother and the child, and childcare.  There are many places in India which
 do not have even these basic facilities.
 There are only 542 medical colleges in the
 country and 313 dental colleges. Just four
 states, like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
 Maharastra and Tamil Nadu have the
 maximum number of medical colleges.</p>

                    <p>Sakal's mother Sheela looked after the domestic chores, children and helped her husband Buta in the field. Sakal's brother, Jeetu, and sister, Seetu, spend their time playing and roaming. Can you call Sheela or Jeetu or Seetu unemployed? If not, why? Unemployment is said to exist when people who are willing to work at the going wages cannot find jobs. Sheela is not interested in working outside her domestic domain. Jeetu and Seetu are too small to be counted in the work force population. Neither Jeetu, Seetu or Sheela can be counted as unemployed. The workforce population includes people from 15 years to 59 years. Sakal's brother and sister do not fall within this age group so they cannot be called unemployed. Sakal's mother Sheela works for the family. She is not willing to work outside her domestic domain for payment. She too cannot be called unemployed. Sakal's grandparents (although not mentioned in the story) cannot be called unemployed.</p>

                    <p>In case of India we have unemployment in rural and urban areas. However, the nature of unemployment differs in rural and urban areas. In case of rural areas, there is seasonal and disguised unemployment. Urban areas have mostly educated unemployment.</p>

                    <p>Seasonal unemployment happens when people are not able to find jobs during some months of the year. People dependant upon agriculture usually face such kind of problem. There are certain busy seasons when sowing, harvesting, weeding and threshing is done. Certain months do not provide much work to the people dependant on agriculture.</p>

                    <p>In case of disguised unemployment people appear to be employed. They have agricultural plot where they find work. This usually happens among family members engaged in agricultural activity. The work requires the service of five people but engages eight people. Three people are extra. These three people also work in the same plot as the others. The contribution made by the three extra people does not add to the contribution made by the five people. If three people are removed the productivity of the field will not decline. The field requires the service of five people and the three extra people are disguised unemployed.</p>

                    <p>In case of urban areas educated unemployment has become a common phenomenon. Many youth with matriculation, graduation and post graduation degrees are not able to find job. A study showed that unemployment of graduate and post-graduate has increased faster than among matriculates. A paradoxical manpower situation is witnessed as surplus of manpower in certain categories coexist with shortage of manpower in others. There is unemployment among technically qualified person on one hand, while there is a dearth of technical skills required for economic growth.</p>

                    <p>Unemployment leads to wastage of manpower resource. People who are an asset for the economy turn into a liability. There is a feeling of hopelessness and despair among the youth. People do not have enough money to support their family. Inability of educated people who are willing to work to find gainful employment implies a great social waste. Unemployment tends to increase economic overload. The dependence of the unemployed on the working population increases. The quality of life of an individual as well as of society is adversely affected. When a family has to live on a bare subsistence level there is a general decline in its health status and rising withdrawal from the school system. Hence, unemployment has detrimental impact on the overall growth of an economy. Increase in unemployment is an indicator of a depressed economy. It also wastes the resource, which could have been gainfully employed. If people cannot be used as a resource they naturally appear as a liability to the economy.</p>

                    <p>In case of India, statistically, the unemployment rate is low. A large number of people represented with low income and productivity are counted as employed. They appear to work throughout the year but in terms of their potential and income, it is not adequate for them. The work that they are pursuing seems forced upon them. They may therefore want other work of their choice. Poor people cannot afford to sit idle. They tend to engage in any activity irrespective of its earning potential. Their earning keeps them on a bare subsistence level. Moreover, the employment structure is characterised by self-employment in the primary sector. The whole family contributes in the field even though not everybody is really needed. So there is disguised unemployment in the agriculture sector. But the entire family shares what has been produced. This concept of sharing of work in the field and the produce raised reduces the hardship of unemployment in the rural sector. But this does not reduce the poverty of the family, gradually surplus labour from every household tends to migrate from the village in search of jobs.</p>

                    <p>Let us discuss about the employment scenario in the three sectors mentioned earlier. Agriculture, is the most labour absorbing sector of the economy. In recent years, there has been a decline in the dependence of population on agriculture partly because of disguised unemployment discussed earlier. Some of the surplus labour in agriculture has moved to either the secondary or the tertiary sector. In the secondary sector, small scale manufacturing is the most labour absorbing. In case of the tertiary sector, various new services are now appearing like biotechnology, information technology and so on.</p>

                    <p>Let us read a story to know how people could become an asset for the economy of a village.</p>

                    <p>Story of a Village There was a village inhabited by several families. Each family produced enough to feed its members. Each family met its needs by the members making their own clothes and teaching their own children. One of the families decided to send one of its sons to an agriculture college. The boy got his admission in the nearby college of agriculture. After some time he became qualified in agro engineering and came back to the village. He proved to be so creative that he could design an improved type of plough, which increased the yield of wheat. Thus a new job of agro engineer was created and filled in the village. The family in the village sold the surplus in a nearby neighbouring village. They earned good profit, which they shared among themselves. Inspired by this success all the families after some time held a meeting in the village. They all wanted to have a better future for their children too. They requested the panchayat to open a school in the village. They assured the panchayat that they would all send their children to school. The panchayat, with the help of government, opened a school. A teacher was recruited from a nearby town. All the children of this village started going to school. After sometime one of the families gave training to his daughter in tailoring. She started stitching clothes for all the families of the village for everyone now wanted to buy and wear well-tailored clothes. Thus another new job, that of a tailor was created. This had another positive effect. The time of the farmers in going far for buying clothes was saved. As the farmers spent more time in the field, the yield of the farms went up. This was the beginning of prosperity. The farmers had more than what they could consume. Now they could sell what they produced to others who came to their village markets. Over time, this village, which formally had no job opportunities in the beginning, had many like teacher, tailor, agro engineer and many more. This was the story of a simple village where the rising level of human capital enabled it to evolve into a place rich with complex and modern economic activities.</p>
