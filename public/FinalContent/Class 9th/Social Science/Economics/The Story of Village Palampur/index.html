some basic concepts relating to production
and this we do through a story of a
hypothetical village called Palampur.*
Farming is the main activity in
Palampur, whereas several other
activities such as small scale
manufacturing, dairy, transport, etc. are
carried out on a limited scale. These
production activities need various types
of resources ‚Äî natural resources, man
made items, human effort, money, etc. As
we read through the story of Palampur,
we will learn how various resources
combine to produce the desired goods and
services in the village.</p>

                    <p>Palampur is well-connected with
neighbouring villages and towns. Raiganj,
a big village, is 3 kms from Palampur. An
all weather road connects the village to
Raiganj and further on to the nearest
small town of Shahpur. Many kinds of
transport are visible on this road starting
from bullock carts, tongas, bogeys (wooden
cart drawn by buffalos) loaded with jaggery
(gur) and other commodities to motor
vehicles like motorcycles, jeeps, tractors
and trucks.
This village has about 450 families
belonging to several different castes. The
80 upper caste families own the majority
of land in the village. Their houses, some
of them quite large, are made of brick with
cement plastering. The SCs (dalits)
comprise one third of the population and
live in one corner of the village and in
much smaller houses some of which are
of mud and straw. Most of the houses have electric connections. Electricity powers all
the tubewells in the fields and is used in
various types of small business. Palampur
has two primary schools and one high
school. There is a primary health centre
run by the government and one private
dispensary where the sick are treated.
‚Ä¢ The description above shows that
Palampur has fairly well-developed
system of roads, transport, electricity,
irrigation, schools and health centre.
Compare these facilities with those in
your nearby village.
The story of Palampur, an imaginary
village, will take us through the different
types of production activities in the
village. In villages across India, farming
is the main production activity. The other
production activities, referred to as non
farm activities include small
manufacturing, transport, shop-keeping,
etc. We shall take a look at both these
types of activities, after learning a few
general things about production.</p>

                    <p> The aim of production is to produce the
goods and services that we want. There
are four requirements for production of
goods and services.
The first requirement is land, and
other natural resources such as water,
forests, minerals.
The second requirement is labour, i.e.
people who will do the work. Some
production activities require highly
educated workers to perform the
necessary tasks. Other activities require
workers who can do manual work. Each
worker is providing the labour necessary
for production.
The third requirement is physical
capital, i.e. the variety of inputs required
at every stage during production. What
are the items that come under physical
capital?

(a) Tools, machines, buildings: Tools and
machines range from very simple tools
such as a farmer's plough to
sophisticated machines such as
generators, turbines, computers, etc.
Tools, machines, buildings can be used
in production over many years, and
are called fixed capital.

(b) Raw materials and money in hand:
Production requires a variety of raw
materials such as the yarn used by
the weaver and the clay used by the
potter. Also, some money is always
required during production to make
payments and buy other necessary
items. Raw materials and money in
hand are called working capital.
Unlike tools, machines and buildings,
these are used up in production.

There is a fourth requirement too. You
will need knowledge and enterprise to be
able to put together land, labour and
physical capital and produce an output
either to use yourself or to sell in the
market. This these days is called human capital. We shall learn more about human
capital in the next chapter.

Every production is organised by
combining land, labour, physical capital
and human capital, which are known as
factors of production. As we read
through the story of Palampur, we will
learn more about the first three factors
of production. For convenience, we will
refer to the physical capital as the capital
in this chapter.

                            <p>Farming is the main production activity in Palampur. 75 per cent of the people who are working are dependent on farming for their livelihood. They could be farmers or farm labourers. The well being of these people is closely related to production on the farms. But remember that there is a basic constraint in raising farm production. Land area under cultivation is practically fixed. Since 1960 in Palampur, there has been no expansion in land area under cultivation. By then, some of the wastelands in the village had been converted to cultivable land. There exists no further scope to increase farm production by bringing new land under cultivation.</p>
                            <p>The standard unit of measuring land is hectare, though in the villages you may find land area being discussed in local units such as bigha, guintha etc. One hectare equals the area of a square with one side measuring 100 metres. Can you compare the area of a 1 hectare field with the area of your school ground?</p>

                            <p>In the kind of crops grown and facilities available, Palampur would resemble a village of the western part of the state of Uttar Pradesh. All land is cultivated in Palampur. No land is left idle. During the rainy season (kharif) farmers grow jowar and bajra. These plants are used as cattle feed. It is followed by cultivation of potato between October and December. In the winter season (rabi), fields are sown with wheat. From the wheat produced, farmers keep enough wheat for the family's consumption and sell the surplus wheat at the market at Raiganj. A part of the land area is also devoted to sugarcane which is harvested once every year. Sugarcane, in its raw form, or as jaggery, is sold to traders in Shahpur.</p>
                            <p>The main reason why farmers are able to grow three different crops in a year in Palampur is due to the well-developed system of irrigation. Electricity came early to Palampur. Its major impact was to transform the system of irrigation. Persian wheels were, till then, used by farmers to draw water from the wells and irrigate small fields. People saw that the electric-run tubewells could irrigate much larger areas of land more effectively. The first few tubewells were installed by the government. Soon, however, farmers started setting up private tubewells. As a result, by mid-1970s the entire cultivated area of 200 hectares (ha.) was irrigated.</p>
                            <p>Not all villages in India have such high levels of irrigation. Apart from the riverine plains, coastal regions in our country are well-irrigated. In contrast, plateau regions such as the Deccan plateau have low levels of irrigation. Of the total cultivated area in the country a little less than 40 per cent is irrigated even today. In the remaining areas, farming is largely dependent on rainfall.</p>
                            <p>To grow more than one crop on a piece of land during the year is known as multiple cropping. It is the most common way of increasing production on a given piece of land. All farmers in Palampur grow atleast two main crops; many are growing potato as the third crop in the past fifteen to twenty years.</p>
                            <p>You have seen that one way of increasing production from the same land is by multiple cropping. The other way is to use modern farming methods for higher yield. Yield is measured as crop produced on a given piece of land during a single season. Till the mid1960s, the seeds used in cultivation were traditional ones with relatively low yields. Traditional seeds needed less irrigation. Farmers used cow-dung and other natural manure as fertilizers. All these were readily available with the farmers who did not have to buy them. The Green Revolution in the late 1960s introduced the Indian farmer to cultivation of wheat and rice using high yielding varieties (HYVs) of seeds. Compared to the traditional seeds, the HYV seeds promised to produce much greater amounts of grain on a single plant. As a result, the same piece of land would now produce far larger quantities of foodgrains than was possible earlier. HYV seeds, however, needed plenty of water and also chemical fertilizers and pesticides to produce best results. Higher yields were possible only from a combination of HYV seeds, irrigation, chemical fertilisers, pesticides, etc. Farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh were the first to try out the modern farming method in India. The farmers in these regions set up tubewells for irrigation, and made use of HYV seeds, chemical fertilisers and pesticides in farming. Some of them bought farm machinery, like tractors and threshers, which made ploughing and harvesting faster. They were rewarded with high yields of wheat.</p>
                            <p>In Palampur, the yield of wheat grown from the traditional varieties was 1300 kg per hectare. With HYV seeds, the yield went up to 3200 kg per hectare. There was a large increase in the production of wheat. Farmers now had greater amounts of surplus wheat to sell in the markets.</p>

                            <p>Land being a natural resource, it is necessary to be careful in its use. Scientific reports indicate that the modern farming methods have overused the natural resource base. In many areas, Green Revolution is associated with the loss of soil fertility due to increased use of chemical fertilisers. Also, continuous use of groundwater for tubewell irrigation has led to the depletion of the water-table. Environmental resources, like soil fertility and groundwater, are built up over years. Once destroyed it is very difficult to restore them. We must take care of the environment to ensure future development of agriculture.</p>
                            <p>Chemical fertilisers provide minerals which dissolve in water and are immediately available to plants. But these may not be retained in the soil for long. They may escape from the soil and pollute groundwater, rivers and lakes. Chemical fertilizers can also kill bacteria and other micro organisms in the soil. This means some time after their use, the soil will be less fertile than ever before.</p>
                            <p>The consumption of chemical fertilizers in Punjab is highest in the country. The continuous use of chemical fertilizers has led to degradation of soil health. Punjab farmers are now forced to use more and more chemical fertilizers and other inputs to achieve the same production level. This means cost of cultivation is rising very fast.</p>

                            <p>You must have realised how important land is for farming. Unfortunately, not all the people engaged in agriculture have sufficient land for cultivation. In Palampur, about one third of the 450 families are landless, i.e. 150 families, most of them dalits, have no land for cultivation. Of the remaining families who own land, 240 families cultivate small plots of land less than 2 hectares in size. Cultivation of such plots doesn't bring adequate income to the farmer family.</p>
                            <p>In 1960, Gobind was a farmer with 2.25 hectares of largely unirrigated land. With the help of his three sons Gobind cultivated the land. Though they didn't live very comfortably, the family managed to feed itself with a little bit of extra income from one buffalo that the family possessed. Some years after Gobind's death, this land was divided among his three sons. Each one now has a plot of land that is only 0.75 hectare in size. Even with improved irrigation and modern farming method, Gobind's sons are not able to make a living from their land. They have to look for additional work during part of the year.</p>
                            <p>You can see the large number of small plots scattered around the village in the picture. These are cultivated by the small farmers. On the other hand, more than half the area of the village is covered by plots that are quite large in size. In Palampur, there are 60 families of medium and large farmers who cultivate more than 2 hectares of land. A few of the large farmers have land extending over 10 hectares or more.</p>

                            <p>After land, labour is the next necessary factor for production. Farming requires a great deal of hard work. Small farmers along with their families cultivate their own fields. Thus, they provide the labour required for farming themselves. Medium and large farmers hire farm labourers to work on their fields.</p>
                            <p>Farm labourers come either from landless families or families cultivating small plots of land. Unlike farmers, farm labourers do not have a right over the crops grown on the land. Instead they are paid wages by the farmer for whom they work. Wages can be in cash or in kind e.g. crop. Sometimes labourers get meals also. Wages vary widely from region to region, from crop to crop, from one farm activity to another (like sowing and harvesting). There is also a wide variation in the duration of employment. A farm labourer might be employed on a daily basis, or for one particular farm activity like harvesting, or for the whole year.</p>
                            <p>Dala is a landless farm labourer who works on daily wages in Palampur. This means he must regularly look for work. The minimum wages for a farm labourer set by the government is Rs 300 per day (March 2019), but Dala gets only Rs 160. There is heavy competition for work among the farm labourers in Palampur, so people agree to work for lower wages. Dala complains about his situation to Ramkali, who is another farm labourer. Both Dala and Ramkali are among the poorest people in the village.</p>

                            <p>You have already seen that the modern farming methods require a great deal of capital, so that the farmer now needs more money than before.</p>
                            <p>1. Most small farmers have to borrow money to arrange for the capital. They borrow from large farmers or the village moneylenders or the traders who supply various inputs for cultivation. The rate of interest on such loans is very high. They are put to great distress to repay the loan.</p>
                            <p>Savita is a small farmer. She plans to cultivate wheat on her 1 hectare of land. Besides seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, she needs cash to buy water and repair her farm instruments. She estimates that the working capital itself would cost a minimum of Rs 3,000. She doesn't have the money, so she decides to borrow from Tejpal Singh, a large farmer. Tejpal Singh agrees to give Savita the loan at an interest rate of 24 per cent for four months, which is a very high interest rate. Savita also has to promise to work on his field as a farm labourer during the harvest season at Rs 100 per day. As you can tell, this wage is quite low. Savita knows that she will have to work very hard to complete harvesting on her own field, and then work as a farm labourer for Tejpal Singh. The harvest time is a very busy time. As a mother of three children she has a lot of household responsibilities. Savita agrees to these tough conditions as she knows getting a loan is difficult for a small farmer.</p>
                            <p>2. In contrast to the small farmers, the medium and large farmers have their own savings from farming. They are thus able to arrange for the capital needed. How do these farmers have their own savings? You shall find the answer in the next section.</p>

                            <p>Let us suppose that the farmers have produced wheat on their lands using the three factors of production. The wheat is harvested and production is complete. What do the farmers do with the wheat? They retain a part of the wheat for the family's consumption and sell the surplus wheat. Small farmers like Savita and Gobind's sons have little surplus wheat because their total production is small and from this a substantial share is kept for their own family needs. So it is the medium and large farmers who supply wheat to the market. The traders at the market buy the wheat and sell it further to shopkeepers in the towns and cities. Tejpal Singh, the large farmer, has a surplus of 350 quintals of wheat from all his lands! He sells the surplus wheat at the Raiganj market and has good earnings.</p>
                            <p>What does Tejpal Singh do with his earnings? Last year, Tejpal Singh had put most of the money in his bank account. Later he used the savings for lending to farmers like Savita who were in need of a loan. He also used the savings to arrange for the working capital for farming in the next season. This year Tejpal Singh plans to use his earnings to buy another tractor. Another tractor would increase his fixed capital.</p>
                            <p>Like Tejpal Singh, other large and medium farmers sell the surplus farm products. A part of the earnings is saved and kept for buying capital for the next season. Thus, they are able to arrange for the capital for farming from their own savings. Some farmers might also use the savings to buy cattle, trucks, or to set up shops. As we shall see, these constitute the capital for non-farm activities.</p>

                            <p>There are variety of vehicles on the road connecting Palampur to Raiganj. Rickshawallahs, tongawallahs, jeep, tractor, truck drivers and people driving the traditional bullock cart and bogey are people in the transport services. They ferry people and goods from one place to another, and in return get paid for it. The number of people involved in transport has grown over the last several years.</p>
                            <p>Kishora is a farm labourer. Like other such labourers, Kishora found it difficult to meet his family's needs from the wages that he received. A few years back Kishora took a loan from the bank. This was under a government programme which was giving cheap loans to poor landless households. Kishora bought a buffalo with this money. He now sells the buffalo's milk. Further, he has attached a wooden cart to his buffalo and uses it to transport various items. Once a week, he goes to the river Ganga to bring back clay for the potter. Or sometimes he goes to Shahpur with a load of jaggery or other commodities. Every month he gets some work in transport. As a result, Kishora is able to earn more than what he used to do some years back.</p>

                    <p> Farming is the main production activity in the village. Over the years there have
 been many important changes in the way farming is practiced. These have allowed
 the farmers to produce more crops from the same amount of land. This is an
 important achievement, since land is fixed and scarce. But in raising production
 a great deal of pressure has been put on land and other natural resources.
 The new ways of farming need less land, but much more of capital. The medium
 and large farmers are able to use their own savings from production to arrange
 for capital during the next season. On the other hand, the small farmers who
 constitute about 80 per cent of total farmers in India, find it difficult to obtain
 capital. Because of the small size of their plots, their production is not enough.
 The lack of surplus means that they are unable to obtain capital from their own
 savings, and have to borrow. Besides the debt, many of the small farmers have
 to do additional work as farm labourers to feed themselves and their families.
 Labour being the most abundant factor of production, it would be ideal if
 new ways of farming used much more labour. Unfortunately, such a thing has
 not happened. The use of labour on farms is limited. The labour, looking for
 opportunities is thus migrating to neighbouring villages, towns and cities. Some
 labour has entered the non-farm sector in the village.
 At present, the non-farm sector in the village is not very large. Out of every
 100 workers in the rural areas in India, only 24 are engaged in non-farm activities.
 Though there is a variety of non-farm activities in the villages (we have only
 seen a few examples), the number of people employed in each is quite small.
 In the future, one would like to see more non-farm production activities in the
 village. Unlike farming, non-farm activities require little land. People with some
 amount of capital can set up non-farm activities. How does one obtain this capital?
 One can either use his own savings, but more often has to take a loan. It is
 important that loan be available at low rate of interest so that even people without
 savings can start some non-farm activity. Another thing which is essential for
 expansion of non-farm activities is to have markets where the goods and services
 produced can be sold. In Palampur, we saw the neighbouring villages, towns and
 cities provide the markets for milk, jaggery, wheat, etc. As more villages get
 connected to towns and cities through good roads, transport and telephone, it is
 possible that the opportunities for non-farm activities in the village would increase
 in the coming years.</p>
