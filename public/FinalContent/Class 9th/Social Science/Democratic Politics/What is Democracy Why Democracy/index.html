              Democracy is one of the most common and preferred forms of
              government in the world today. It is based on the simple idea that
              people have the right to choose their rulers and influence
              decisions that affect their lives. This chapter explains the basic
              features that make a government democratic and helps us
              distinguish it from non-democratic systems. It also explores why
              democracy has spread across countries and what makes it better
              than other forms of government. In the end, the chapter broadens
              the idea of democracy beyond its minimum definition.

              What is democracy? What are its features? This chapter builds on a
              simple definition of democracy. Step by step, we work out the
              meaning of the terms involved in this definition. The aim here is
              to understand clearly the bare minimum features of a democratic
              form of government. After going through this chapter we should be
              able to distinguish a democratic form of government from a
              non-democratic government. Towards the end of this chapter, we
              step beyond this minimal objective and introduce a broader idea of
              democracy.

              Democracy is the most prevalent form of government in the world
              today and it is expanding to more countries. But why is it so?
              What makes it better than other forms of government? That is the
              second big question that we take up in this chapter.

              by Merry. She does not like this way of defining democracy and
              wants to ask some basic questions. Her teacher Matilda Lyngdoh
              responds to her questions, as other classmates join the
              discussion:

                <p>
                  <strong>Merry:</strong> Ma'am, I don't like this idea. First
                  we spend time discussing democracy and then we want to find
                  out the meaning of democracy. I mean logically shouldn't we
                  have approached it the other way round? Shouldn't the meaning
                  have come first and then the example?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Lyngdoh Madam:</strong> I can see your point. But that
                  is not how we reason in everyday life. We use words like pen,
                  rain or love. Do we wait to have a definition of these words
                  before we use them? Come to think of it, do we have clear
                  definition of these words? It is only by using a word that we
                  understand its meaning.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Merry:</strong> But then why do we need definitions at
                  all?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Lyngdoh Madam:</strong> We need a definition only when
                  we come across a difficulty in the use of a word. We need a
                  definition of rain only when we wish to distinguish it from,
                  say, drizzle or cloudburst. The same is true for democracy. We
                  need a clear definition only because people use it for
                  different purposes, because very different kinds of
                  governments call themselves democracy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Ribiang:</strong> But why do we need to work on a
                  definition? The other day you quoted Abraham Lincoln to us:
                  "Democracy is government of the people, by the people and for
                  the people". We in Meghalaya always ruled ourselves. That is
                  accepted by everyone. Why do we need to change that?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Lyngdoh Madam:</strong> I am not saying we need to
                  change it. I too find this definition very beautiful. But we
                  don't know if this is the best way of defining unless we think
                  about it ourselves. We must not accept something just because
                  it is famous, just because everyone accepts it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Yolanda:</strong> Ma'am, can I suggest something? We
                  don't need to look for any definition. I read somewhere that
                  the word democracy comes from a Greek word 'Demokratia'. In
                  Greek 'demos' means people and 'kratia' means rule. So
                  democracy is rule by the people. This is the correct meaning.
                  Where is the need to debate?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Lyngdoh Madam:</strong> That is also a very helpful
                  way of thinking about this matter. I would just say that this
                  does not always work. A word does not remain tied to its
                  origin. Just think of computers. Originally they were used for
                  computing, that is to say calculating, very difficult
                  mathematical sums. These were very powerful calculators. But
                  nowadays very few people use computers for computing sums.
                  They use it for writing, for designing, for listening to music
                  and for watching films. Words remain the same but their
                  meaning can change with time. In that case it is not very
                  useful to look at the origins of a word.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Merry:</strong> Ma'am, so basically what you are
                  saying is that there is no shortcut to our thinking about the
                  matter ourselves. We have to think about its meaning and
                  evolve a definition.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Lyngdoh Madam:</strong> You got me right. Let us get
                  on with it now.

              <div class="feature-desc" style="display: none">
                <p>
                  Let us get back to our discussion on similarities and
                  differences among governments that are called democracies. One
                  simple factor common to all democracies is: the government is
                  chosen by the people.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We could thus start with a simple definition:
                  <strong
                    >democracy is a form of government in which the rulers are
                    elected by the people.</strong
                  >
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is a useful starting point. This definition allows us to
                  separate democracy from forms of government that are clearly
                  not democratic. The army rulers of Myanmar were not elected by
                  the people. Those who happened to be in control of the army
                  became the rulers of the country. People had no say in this
                  decision. Dictators like Pinochet (Chile) are not elected by
                  the people. This also applies to monarchies. The kings of
                  Saudi Arabia rule not because the people have chosen them to
                  do so but because they happen to be born into the royal
                  family.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This simple definition is not adequate. It reminds us that
                  democracy is people's rule. But if we use this definition in
                  an unthinking manner, we would end up calling almost every
                  government that holds an election a democracy. That would be
                  very misleading. As we shall find out in Chapter 3, every
                  government in contemporary world wants to be called a
                  democracy, even if it is not so. That is why we need to
                  carefully distinguish between a government that is a democracy
                  and one that pretends to be one. We can do so by understanding
                  each word in this definition carefully and spelling out the
                  features of a democratic government.

            FEATURES OF DEMOCRACY

              We have started with a simple definition that democracy is a form
              of government in which the rulers are elected by the people. This
              raises many questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Who are the rulers in this definition? Which officials must be
                elected for any government to be called a democracy? Which
                decisions may be taken by non-elected officials in a democracy?
              </li>
              <li>
                What kind of election constitutes a democratic election? What
                conditions must be fulfilled for an election to be considered
                democratic?
              </li>
              <li>
                Who are the people who can elect the rulers or get elected as
                rulers? Should this include every citizen on an equal basis? Can
                a democracy deny some citizens this right?
              </li>
              <li>
                Finally, what kind of a form of government is democracy? Can
                elected rulers do whatever they want in a democracy? Or must a
                democratic government function with some limits? Is it necessary
                for a democracy to respect some rights of the citizens?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Let us consider each of these questions with the help of some
              examples.

                <p>
                  In Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf led a military coup in
                  October 1999. He overthrew a democratically elected government
                  and declared himself the 'Chief Executive' of the country.
                  Later he changed his designation to President and in 2002 held
                  a referendum in the country that granted him a five-year
                  extension. Pakistani media, human rights organisations and
                  democracy activists said that the referendum was based on
                  malpractices and fraud. In August 2002 he issued a 'Legal
                  Framework Order' that amended the Constitution of Pakistan.
                  According to this Order, the President can dismiss the
                  national and provincial assemblies. The work of the civilian
                  cabinet is supervised by a National Security Council which is
                  dominated by military officers. After passing this law,
                  elections were held to the national and provincial assemblies.
                  So Pakistan has had elections, elected representatives have
                  some powers. But the final power rested with military officers
                  and General Musharraf himself.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Clearly, there are many reasons why Pakistan under General
                  Musharraf should not be called a democracy. But let us focus
                  on one of these. Can we say that the rulers are elected by the
                  people in Pakistan? Not quite. People may have elected their
                  representatives to the national and provincial assemblies but
                  those elected representatives were not really the rulers. They
                  cannot take the final decisions. The power to take final
                  decision rested with army officials and with General
                  Musharraf, and none of them were elected by the people. This
                  happens in many dictatorships and monarchies. They formally
                  have an elected parliament and government but the real power
                  is with those who are not elected.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In a few countries, the real power was with some external
                  powers and not with locally elected representatives. This
                  cannot be called people's rule.

                  In China, elections are regularly held after every five years
                  for electing the country's parliament, called Quanguo Renmin
                  Daibiao Dahui (National People's Congress). The National
                  People's Congress has the power to appoint the President of
                  the country. It has nearly 3,000 members elected from all over
                  China. Some members are elected by the army. Before contesting
                  elections, a candidate needs the approval of the Chinese
                  Communist Party. Only those who are members of the Chinese
                  Communist Party or eight smaller parties allied to it were
                  allowed to contest elections held in 2002-03. The government
                  is always formed by the Communist Party.

                  Since its independence in 1930, Mexico holds elections after
                  every six years to elect its President. The country has never
                  been under a military or dictator's rule. But until 2000 every
                  election was won by a party called PRI (Institutional
                  Revolutionary Party). Opposition parties did contest
                  elections, but never managed to win. The PRI was known to use
                  many dirty tricks to win elections. All those who were
                  employed in government offices had to attend its party
                  meetings. Teachers of government schools used to force parents
                  to vote for the PRI. Media largely ignored the activities of
                  opposition political parties except to criticise them.
                  Sometimes the polling booths were shifted from one place to
                  another in the last minute, which made it difficult for people
                  to cast their votes. The PRI spent a large sum of money in the
                  campaign for its candidates.

                  Should we consider the elections described above as examples
                  of people electing their rulers? Reading these examples we get
                  a sense that we cannot. There are many problems here. In China
                  the elections do not offer the people any serious choice. They
                  have to choose the ruling party and the candidates approved by
                  it. Can we call this a choice? In the Mexican example, people
                  seemed to really have a choice but in practice they had no
                  choice. There was no way the ruling party could be defeated,
                  even if people were against it. These are not fair elections.

                    The elections must offer a real choice between political
                    alternatives. And it should be possible for people to use
                    this choice to remove the existing rulers, if they wish so.
                    So, a democracy must be based on a free and fair election
                    where those currently in power have a fair chance of losing.

                  Earlier, we read about how the struggle for democracy was
                  linked to the demand for universal adult franchise. This
                  principle has now come to be accepted almost all over the
                  world. Yet there are many instances of denial of equal right
                  to vote.

                  Until 2015, in Saudi Arabia women did not have the right to
                  vote. Estonia has made its citizenship rules in such a way
                  that people belonging to Russian minority find it difficult to
                  get the right to vote.

                  In Fiji, the electoral system is such that the vote of an

                  Zimbabwe attained independence from White minority rule in
                  1980. Since then the country has been ruled by ZANU-PF, the
                  party that led the freedom struggle. Its leader, Robert
                  Mugabe, ruled the country since independence. Elections were
                  held regularly and always won by ZANU-PF. President Mugabe was
                  popular but also used unfair practices in elections. Over the
                  years his government changed the constitution several times to
                  increase the powers of the President and make him less
                  accountable. Opposition party workers were harassed and their
                  meeting disrupted. Public protests and demonstrations against
                  the government were declared illegal. There was a law that
                  limited the right to criticise the President. Television and
                  radio were controlled by the government and gave only the
                  ruling party's version. There were independent newspapers but
                  the government harassed those journalists who went against it.
                  The government ignored some court judgments that went against
                  it and pressurised judges. He was forced out of office in
                  2017.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The example of Zimbabwe shows that popular approval of the
                  rulers is necessary in a democracy, but it is not sufficient.
                  Popular governments can be undemocratic. Popular leaders can
                  be autocratic. If we wish to assess a democracy, it is
                  important to look at the elections. But it is equally
                  important to look before and after the elections. There should
                  be sufficient room for normal political activity, including
                  political opposition, in the period before elections. This
                  requires that the state should respect some basic rights of
                  the citizen. They should be free to think, to have opinions,
                  to express these in public, to form associations, to protest
                  and take other political actions. Everyone should be equal in
                  the eyes of law. These rights must be protected by an
                  independent judiciary whose orders are obeyed by everyone. We
                  shall read more about these rights in Chapter 5.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Similarly, there are some conditions that apply to the way a
                  government is run after the elections. A democratic government
                  cannot do whatever it likes, simply because it has won an
                  election. It has to respect some basic rules. In particular it
                  has to respect some guarantees to the minorities. Every major
                  decision has to go through a series of consultations. Every
                  office bearer has certain rights and responsibilities assigned
                  by the constitution and the law. Each of these is accountable
                  not only to the people but also to other independent
                  officials. We shall read more about this in Chapter 4.

                  definition that democracy is a form of government in which the
                  rulers are elected by the people. We found that this

                  key words used in it. Through a series of examples we worked
                  out four features of democracy as a form of government.
                  Accordingly, democracy is a form of government in which:

              An argument broke out in Madam Lyngdoh's class. She had finished
              teaching the previous section on what is democracy and asked the
              students if they thought democracy was the best form of
              government. Everyone had something to say.

              <div class="feature-desc" style="display: none">
                <p>
                  <strong>Yolanda:</strong> We live in a democratic country. All
                  over the world people want democracy. Countries that were not
                  democratic earlier are becoming democratic now. All great
                  people have said nice things about democracy. Isn't it obvious
                  that democracy is the best? Do we need to debate this?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Tangkini:</strong> But Lyngdoh Madam had said we
                  should not accept something just because it is famous, just
                  because everyone else accepts it. Isn't it possible that
                  everyone is following a wrong path?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Jeni:</strong> Yes, it actually is a wrong path. What
                  has democracy brought to our country? Seven decades of
                  democracy and there is so much poverty in the country.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Ribiang:</strong> But what has democracy got to do
                  with it? Do we have poverty because we are democratic or do we
                  have poverty despite being a democracy?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Jeni:</strong> Whatever, how does it make a
                  difference? The point is that this can't be the best form of
                  government. Democracy is all about chaos, instability,
                  corruption and hypocrisy. Politicians fight among themselves.
                  Who cares for the country?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Poimon:</strong> So, what should we have instead? Go
                  back to the British rule? Invite some kings to rule this
                  country?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Rose:</strong> I don't know. I think what this country
                  needs is a strong leader, someone who does not have to bother
                  about elections and parliament. One leader should have all the
                  powers. He should be able to do whatever is needed in
                  country's interest. That alone can remove corruption and
                  poverty from this country.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Someone shouted:</strong> That is called dictatorship!
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Hoi:</strong> What if that person starts using all
                  these powers for himself and his family? What if he is corrupt
                  himself?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Rose:</strong> I am speaking only of the honest,
                  sincere and strong leader.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Hoi:</strong> But that is not fair. You are comparing
                  a real democracy with an ideal dictatorship. We should compare
                  an ideal with an ideal, the real with the real. Go and check
                  the record of dictators in real life. They are most corrupt,
                  selfish and brutal. It is just that we don't get to know about
                  this. And what is worse, you can't even get rid of them.

                  This conversation has most of the arguments that we routinely

                  arguments:

                    <strong
                      >Elected leaders do not know the best interest of the

                  </li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong
                      >Ordinary people don't know what is good for them; they
                      should not decide anything.</strong
                    >
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Are there some other arguments against democracy that you can
                  think of? Which of these arguments applies mainly to
                  democracy? Which of these can apply to misuse of any form of
                  government? Which of these do you agree with?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Clearly, democracy is not a magical solution for all the
                  problems. It has not ended poverty in our country and in other
                  parts of the world. Democracy as a form of government only
                  ensures that people take their own decisions. This does not
                  guarantee that their decisions will be good. People can make
                  mistakes. Involving the people in these decisions does lead to
                  delays in decision making. It is also true that democracy
                  leads to frequent changes in leadership. Sometimes this can
                  set back big decisions and affect the government's efficiency.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These arguments show that democracy of the kind we see may not
                  be the ideal form of government. But that is not a question we
                  face in real life. The real question we face is different: is
                  democracy better than other forms of government that are there
                  for us to choose from?

                  China's famine of 1958-1961 was the worst recorded famine in
                  world history. Nearly three crore people died in this famine.
                  During those days, India's economic condition was not much
                  better than China. Yet India did not have a famine of the kind
                  China had. Economists think that this was a result of
                  different government policies in the two countries. The
                  existence of democracy in India made the Indian government
                  respond to food scarcity in a way that the Chinese government
                  did not. They point out that no large-scale famine has ever
                  taken place in an independent and democratic country. If China
                  too had multiparty elections, an opposition party and a press
                  free to criticise the government, then so many people may not
                  have died in the famine.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This example brings out one of the reasons why democracy is
                  considered the best form of government.
                  <strong
                    >Democracy is better than any other form of government in
                    responding to the needs of the people.</strong
                  >
                  A non-democratic government may and can respond to the
                  people's needs, but it all depends on the wishes of the people
                  who rule. If the rulers don't want to, they don't have to act
                  according to the wishes of the people. A democracy requires
                  that the rulers have to attend to the needs of the people. A
                  democratic government is a better government because it is a
                  more accountable form of government.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There is another reason why democracy should lead to better
                  decisions than any non-democratic government.
                  <strong
                    >Democracy is based on consultation and discussion.</strong
                  >
                  A democratic decision always involves many persons,
                  discussions and meetings. When a number of people put their
                  heads together, they are able to point out possible mistakes
                  in any decision. This takes time. But there is a big advantage
                  in taking time over important decisions. This reduces the
                  chances of rash or irresponsible decisions. Thus democracy
                  improves the quality of decision-making.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is related to the third argument.
                  <strong
                    >Democracy provides a method to deal with differences and
                    conflicts.</strong
                  >
                  In any society people are bound to have differences of
                  opinions and interests. These differences are particularly
                  sharp in a country like ours which has an amazing social
                  diversity. People belong to different regions, speak different
                  languages, practise different religions and have different
                  castes. They look at the world very differently and have
                  different preferences. The preferences of one group can clash
                  with those of other groups. How do we resolve such a conflict?
                  The conflict can be solved by brutal power. Whichever group is
                  more powerful will dictate its terms and others will have to
                  accept that. But that would lead to resentment and
                  unhappiness. Different groups may not be able to live together
                  for long in such a way. Democracy provides the only peaceful
                  solution to this problem. In democracy, no one is a permanent
                  winner. No one is a permanent loser. Different groups can live
                  with one another peacefully. In a diverse country like India,
                  democracy keeps our country together.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These three arguments were about the effects of democracy on
                  the quality of government and social life. But the strongest
                  argument for democracy is not about what democracy does to the
                  government. It is about what democracy does to the citizens.
                  Even if democracy does not bring about better decisions and
                  accountable government, it is still better than other forms of
                  government.
                  <strong>Democracy enhances the dignity of citizens.</strong>
                  As we discussed above, democracy is based on the principle of
                  political equality, on recognising that the poorest and the
                  least educated has the same status as the rich and the
                  educated. People are not subjects of a ruler, they are the
                  rulers themselves. Even when they make mistakes, they are
                  responsible for their conduct.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Finally, democracy is better than other forms of government
                  because it allows us to correct its own mistakes. As we saw
                  above, there is no guarantee that mistakes cannot be made in
                  democracy. No form of government can guarantee that. The
                  advantage in a democracy is that such mistakes cannot be
                  hidden for long. There is a space for public discussion on
                  these mistakes. And there is a room for correction. Either the
                  rulers have to change their decisions, or the rulers can be
                  changed. This cannot happen in a non-democratic government.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong
                    >Let us sum it up. Democracy cannot get us everything and is
                    not the solution to all problems. But it is clearly better
                    than any other alternative that we know. It offers better
                    chances of a good decision, it is likely to respect people's
                    own wishes and allows different kinds of people to live
                    together. Even when it fails to do some of these things, it
                    allows a way of correcting its mistakes and offers more
                    dignity to all citizens. That is why democracy is considered
                    the best form of government.</strong

            BROADER MEANINGS OF DEMOCRACY
          </h2>

          <div class="content-block">
            <p>
              In this chapter we have considered the meaning of democracy in a
              limited and descriptive sense. We have understood democracy as a
              form of government. This way of defining democracy helps us to
              identify a clear set of minimal features that a democracy must
              have. The most common form that democracy takes in our times is
              that of a representative democracy. You have already read about
              this in the previous classes. In the countries we call democracy,
              all the people do not rule. A majority is allowed to take
              decisions on behalf of all the people. Even the majority does not
              rule directly. The majority of people rule through their elected
              representatives.
            </p>

            <p>This become necessary because:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Modern democracies involve such a large number of people that it
                is physically impossible for them to sit together and take a
                collective decision.
              </li>
              <li>
                Even if they could, the citizen does not have the time, the
                desire or the skills to take part in all the decisions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This gives us a clear but minimal understanding of democracy. This
              clarity helps us to distinguish democracies from non-democracies.
              But it does not allow us to distinguish between a democracy and a
              good democracy. It does not allow us to see the operation of
              democracy beyond government. For this we need to turn to broader
              meanings of democracy.

              Sometimes we use democracy for organisations other than the
              government. Just read these statements:
            </p>

                "We are a very democratic family. Whenever a decision has to be
                taken, we all sit down and arrive at a consensus. My opinion
                matters as much as my father's."
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-card">

                "I don't like teachers who do not allow students to speak and
                ask questions in the class. I would like to have teachers with
                democratic temperament."
              </div>

              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
              These ways of using the word democracy go back to its basic sense
              of a method of taking decisions. A democratic decision involves
              consultation with and consent of all those who are affected by
              that decision. Those who are not powerful have the same say in
              taking the decision as those who are powerful. This can apply to a
              government or a family or any other organisation. Thus democracy
              is also a principle that can be applied to any sphere of life.

          <div class="content-block">
            <p>
              Sometimes we use the word democracy not to describe any existing
              government but to set up an ideal standard that all democracies
              must aim to become:
            </p>

            <div class="quote-card">
              <div class="quote-text">
                "True democracy will come to this country only when no one goes
                hungry to bed."
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-card">
              <div class="quote-text">
                "In a democracy every citizen must be able to play equal role in
                decision making. For this you don't need just an equal right to
                vote. Every citizen needs to have equal information, basic
                education, equal resources and a lot of commitment."
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
              If we take these ideals seriously, then no country in the world is
              a democracy. Yet an understanding of democracy as an ideal reminds
              us of why we value democracy. It enables us to judge an existing
              democracy and identify its weaknesses. It helps us to distinguish
              between a minimal democracy and a good democracy.

              In this book we do not deal much with this expanded notion of
              democracy. Our focus here is with some core institutional features
              of democracy as a form of government. Next year you will read more
              about a democratic society and ways of evaluating our democracy.
              At this stage we just need to note that democracy can apply to
              many spheres of life and that democracy can take many forms. There
              can be various ways of taking decisions in a democratic manner, as
              long as the basic principle of consultation on an equal basis is
              accepted. The most common form of democracy in today's world is
              rule through people's elected representatives. We shall read more
              about that in Chapter 3. But if the community is small, there can
              be other ways of taking democratic decisions. All the people can
              sit together and take decisions directly. This is how Gram Sabha
              should work in a village. Can you think of some other democratic
              ways of decision making?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-block">
            <p>
              This also means that no country is a perfect democracy. The
              features of democracy that we discussed in this chapter provide
              only the minimum conditions of a democracy. That does not make it
              an ideal democracy. Every democracy has to try to realise the
              ideals of a democratic decision-making. This cannot be achieved
              once and for all. This requires a constant effort to save and
              strengthen democratic forms of decision-making. What we do as
              citizens can make a difference to making our country more or less
              democratic. This is the strength and the weakness of democracy:
              the fate of the country depends not just on what the rulers do,
              but mainly on what we, as citizens, do.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong
                >This is what distinguished democracy from other governments.
                Other forms of government like monarchy, dictatorship or
                one-party rule do not require all citizens to take part in
                politics. In fact most non-democratic governments would like
                citizens not to take part in politics. But democracy depends on
                active political participation by all the citizens. That is why
                a study of democracy must focus on democratic politics.</strong

                    <h4>
                        Q5. In 2004 a report published in USA pointed to the increasing
                        inequalities in that country. Inequalities in income reflected in the
                        participation of people in democracy. It also shaped their abilities to
                        influence the decisions taken by the government. The report
                        highlighted that:<br><br>
                        a) If an average Black family earns $ 100 then the income of average
                        White family is $ 162. A White family has twelve times more wealth
                        than the average Black family. <br><br>
                        b) In a President‚Äôs election ‚Äònearly 9 out of 10 individuals in families
                        with income over $ 75,000 have voted. These people are the top
                        20% of the population in terms of their income. On the other hand
                        only 5 people out of 10 from families with income less than $
                        15,000 have voted. They are the bottom 20% of the population in
                        terms of their income.<br><br>
                        c) About 95% contribution to the political parties comes from the
                        rich. This gives them opportunity to express their opinions and
                        concerns, which is not available to most citizens.<br><br>
                        d) As poor sections participate less in politics, the government does
                        not listen to their concerns ‚Äì coming out of poverty, getting job,
                        education, health care and housing for them. Politicians hear most
                        regularly about the concerns of business persons and the rich.<br><br>
                        Write an essay on ‚ÄòDemocracy and Poverty‚Äô using the information
                        given in this report but using examples from India.
