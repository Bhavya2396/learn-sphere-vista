    <p>WRITING in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only because I've never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the <span class="highlight-vocab">musings<span class="vocab-tooltip">thoughts, reflections</span></span> of a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn't matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest.</p>

    <p>'Paper has more patience than people.' I thought of this saying on one of those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my hands, bored and <span class="highlight-vocab">listless<span class="vocab-tooltip">with no energy or interest</span></span>, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed where I was, <span class="highlight-vocab">brooding<span class="vocab-tooltip">thinking deeply about something that makes one sad or worried</span></span>: Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I'm not planning to let anyone else read this <span class="highlight-vocab">stiff-backed<span class="vocab-tooltip">having a rigid back</span></span> notebook grandly referred to as a 'diary', unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won't make a bit of difference.</p>

    <p>Now I'm back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don't have a friend.</p>
    
    <p>Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old girl is completely alone in the world. And I'm not. I have loving parents and a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I'm with friends is having a good time. I can't bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don't seem to be able to get any closer, and that's the problem. Maybe it's my fault that we don't <span class="highlight-vocab">confide<span class="vocab-tooltip">tell personal things privately to a person that one trusts</span></span> in each other. In any case, that's just how things are, and <span class="highlight-vocab">unfortunately<span class="vocab-tooltip">by bad luck</span></span> they're not liable to change. This is why I've started the diary.</p>

    <p>To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don't want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary to be my friend, and I'm going to call this friend 'Kitty'.</p>

    <p>Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right in, I'd better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so.</p>
    
    <p>My father, the most adorable father I've ever seen, didn't marry my mother until he was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister, Margot, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1926. I was born on 12 June 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I was four. My father <span class="highlight-vocab">emigrated<span class="vocab-tooltip">left one's country to live in another</span></span> to Holland in 1933. My mother, Edith Hollander Frank, went with him to Holland in September, while Margot and I were sent to Aachen to stay with our grandmother. Margot went to Holland in December, and I followed in February, when I was <span class="highlight-vocab">plunked down<span class="vocab-tooltip">put down in a casual way</span></span> on the table as a birthday present for Margot.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>I started right away at the Montessori nursery school. I stayed there until I was six, at which time I started in the first form. In the sixth form my teacher was Mrs Kuperus, the <span class="highlight-vocab">headmistress<span class="vocab-tooltip">a woman who is the head teacher of a school</span></span>. At the end of the year we were both in tears as we said a heartbreaking farewell.</p>

    <p>In the summer of 1941 Grandma fell ill and had to have an operation, so my birthday passed with little celebration.</p>
    
    <p>Grandma died in January 1942. No one knows how often I think of her and still love her. This birthday celebration in 1942 was intended to make up for the other, and Grandma's candle was lit along with the rest.</p>
    
    <p>The four of us are still doing well, and that brings me to the present date of 20 June 1942, and the solemn dedication of my diary.</p>

    <p>Saturday, 20 June 1942<br>Dearest Kitty,</p>
    
    <p>Our entire class is <span class="highlight-vocab">quaking in its boots<span class="vocab-tooltip">shaking with fear and nervousness</span></span>. The reason, of course, is the forthcoming meeting in which the teachers decide who'll move up to the next form and who'll be kept back. Half the class is making bets. G.N. and I laugh ourselves silly at the two boys behind us, C.N. and Jacques, who have staked their entire holiday savings on their bet. From morning to night, it's "You're going to pass", "No, I'm not", "Yes, you are", "No, I'm not". Even G.'s pleading glances and my angry outbursts can't calm them down. If you ask me, there are so many dummies that about a quarter of the class should be kept back, but teachers are the most unpredictable creatures on earth.</p>

        <div class="definition">shaking with fear and nervousness</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>I'm not so worried about my girlfriends and myself. We'll make it. The only subject I'm not sure about is maths. Anyway, all we can do is wait. Until then, we keep telling each other not to lose heart.</p>
    
    <p>I get along pretty well with all my teachers. There are nine of them, seven men and two women. Mr Keesing, the <span class="highlight-vocab">old fogey<span class="vocab-tooltip">an old-fashioned person</span></span> who teaches maths, was annoyed with me for ages because I talked so much. After several warnings, he assigned me extra homework. An essay on the subject, 'A Chatterbox'. A chatterbox ‚Äî what can you write about that? I'd worry about that later, I decided. I jotted down the title in my notebook, tucked it in my bag and tried to keep quiet.</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">old fogey</div>
        <div class="definition">an old-fashioned person</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>That evening, after I'd finished the rest of my homework, the note about the essay caught my eye. I began thinking about the subject while chewing the tip of my fountain pen. Anyone could <span class="highlight-vocab">ramble on<span class="vocab-tooltip">talk or write aimlessly for long</span></span> and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with <span class="highlight-vocab">convincing arguments<span class="vocab-tooltip">a statement made in such a manner that people believe it</span></span> to prove the necessity of talking. I thought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the three pages Mr Keesing had assigned me and was satisfied. I argued that talking is a student's trait and that I would do my best to keep it under control, but that I would never be able to cure myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as I did if not more, and that there's not much you can do about <span class="highlight-vocab">inherited traits<span class="vocab-tooltip">qualities (physical or mental) that one gets from one's parents</span></span>.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>Mr Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way through the next lesson, he assigned me a second essay. This time it was supposed to be on 'An <span class="highlight-vocab">Incorrigible<span class="vocab-tooltip">something that cannot be corrected (usually a bad quality)</span></span> Chatterbox'. I handed it in, and Mr Keesing had nothing to complain about for two whole lessons. However, during the third lesson he'd finally had enough. "Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in class, write an essay entitled ‚Äî 'Quack, Quack, Quack, Said Mistress Chatterbox'."</p>
    
    <div class="vocabulary-note">
        <div class="word">incorrigible</div>
        <div class="definition">something that cannot be corrected (usually a bad quality)</div>
    </div>
    
    <p>The class roared. I had to laugh too, though I'd nearly exhausted my <span class="highlight-vocab">ingenuity<span class="vocab-tooltip">originality and inventiveness</span></span> on the topic of chatterboxes. It was time to come up with something else, something original. My friend, Sanne, who's good at poetry, offered to help me write the essay from beginning to end in verse and I jumped for joy. Mr Keesing was trying to play a joke on me with this ridiculous subject, but I'd make sure the joke was on him.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>I finished my poem, and it was beautiful! It was about a mother duck and a father swan with three baby ducklings who were bitten to death by the father because they quacked too much. Luckily, Mr Keesing took the joke the right way. He read the poem to the class, adding his own comments, and to several other classes as well. Since then I've been allowed to talk and haven't been assigned any extra homework. On the contrary, Mr Keesing's always making jokes these days.</p>
    
    <p>Yours,</p>
