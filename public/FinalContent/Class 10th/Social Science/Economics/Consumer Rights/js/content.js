            India has been observing 24 December as the National Consumers'
            Day. It was on this day that the Indian Parliament enacted the Consumer
            Protection Act in 1986. India is one of the countries that have exclusive
            authority for consumer redressal.
            The consumer movement in India
            has made some progress in terms of
            numbers of organised groups and  their activities. There are today more
            than 2000 consumer groups in the
            country of which only about 50-60
            are well organised and recognised for
            their work.
            However, the consumer redressal
            process is becoming cumbersome,
            expensive and time consuming. Many
            a time, consumers are required to
            engage lawyers. These cases require time for filing and attending the
            commission proceedings etc. In most
            purchases cash memos are not issued
            hence evidence is not easy to gather.
            Moreover most purchases in the
            market are small retail sales. The
            COPRA was amended in the year
            2019 to further strengthen
            consumers in India. Buying through
            internet is now included. If there is any
            service deficiency or defective product,
            service provider or manufacturer is
            also held responsible and would be
            penalized or even imprisoned.
            Settlement of disputes with the help
            of a neutral intermediary outside the
            Consumer Disputes Redressal
            Commission, called mediator, is now  encouraged at all the three tiers
            Consumer Commissions. After more
            than 30 years of the enactment of
            COPRA, consumer awareness in India
            is spreading but slowly. Besides this
            the enforcement of laws that protect
            workers, especially in the
            unorganised sectors is weak.
            Similarly, rules and regulations for
            working of markets are often not
            followed.
            Nevertheless, there is scope for
            consumers to realise their role and
            importance. It is often said that
            consumer movements can be effective
            only with the consumers' active
            involvement. It requires a voluntary
            effort and struggle involving the
            participation of one and all.
