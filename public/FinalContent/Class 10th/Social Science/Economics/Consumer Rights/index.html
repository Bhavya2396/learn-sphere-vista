              Consumer rights are an important aspect of how markets function
              and affect our daily lives. This chapter explores the challenges
              consumers face, such as unfair practices and weak enforcement of
              rules, and highlights the importance of being informed and active
              participants in the consumer movement. Through real-life case
              histories and examples of organisations protecting consumer
              interests, students will understand how awareness, legal support,
              and collective action have helped safeguard consumer rights in
              India.

              This chapter proposes to discuss the issue of consumer rights
              within the context of the ways markets operate in our country.
              There are many aspects of unequal situations in a market and poor
              enforcement of rules and regulations. Hence, there is a need to
              sensitise learners and encourage them to participate in the
              consumer movement. This chapter provides case histories ‚Äî how some
              consumers were exploited in real life situation and how legal
              institutions helped consumers in getting compensated and in
              upholding their rights. The case histories would enable the
              students to link these narratives to their life experiences. We
              have to enable students to understand that the awareness of being
              a well-informed consumer arose out of consumer movement and active
              participation of people through their struggles over a long
              period. This chapter also provides details of a few organisations
              helping consumers in different ways. Finally, it ends with some
              critical issues of the consumer movement in India.

              We participate in the market both as producers and consumers. As
              producers of goods and services we could be working in any of the
              sectors discussed earlier such as agriculture, industry, or
              services. Consumers participate in the market when they purchase
              goods and services that they need. These are the final goods that
              people as consumers use. In the preceding chapters we discussed
              the need for rules and regulations or steps that would promote
              development.</p>
              
              <p>These could be for the protection of workers in the
              unorganised sector or to protect people from high interest rates
              charged by moneylenders in the informal sector. Similarly, rules
              and regulations are also required for protecting the environment.
              For example, moneylenders in the informal sector that you read
              about in Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to bind the borrower: they
              could make the producer sell the produce to them at a low rate in
              return for a timely loan; they could force a small farmer like
              Swapna to sell her land to pay back the loan. Similarly, many
              people who work in the unorganised sector have to work at a low
              wage and accept conditions that are not fair and are also often
              harmful to their health. To prevent such exploitation, we have
              talked of rules and regulations for their protection. There are
              organisations that have struggled for long to ensure that these
              rules are followed.Likewise, rules and regulations are required
              for the protection of the consumers in the marketplace. Individual
              consumers often find themselves in a weak position. Whenever there
              is a complaint regarding a good or service that had been bought,
              the seller tries to shift all the responsibility on to the buyer.
              Their position usually is ‚Äì "If you didn't like what you bought,
              please go elsewhere". </p>
              
              <p>As if the seller has no responsibility once
              a sale is completed! The consumer movement, as we shall discuss
              later, is an effort to change this situation. Exploitation in the
              marketplace happens in various ways. For example, sometimes
              traders indulge in unfair trade practices such as when shopkeepers
              weigh less than what they should or when traders add charges that
              were not mentioned before, or when adulterated/defective goods are
              sold. Markets do not work in a fair manner when producers are few
              and powerful whereas consumers purchase in small amounts and are
              scattered. This happens especially when large companies are
              producing these goods. These companies with huge wealth, power and
              reach can manipulate the market in various ways. At times false
              information is passed on through the media, and other sources to
              attract consumers. For example, a company for years sold powder
              milk for babies all over the world as the most scientific product
              claiming this to be better than mother's milk. It took years of
              struggle before the company was forced to accept that it had been
              making false claims. Similarly, a long battle had to be fought
              with court cases to make cigarette manufacturing companies accept
              that their product could cause cancer. Hence, there is a need for
              rules and regulations to ensure protection for consumers.

            <p>
              The consumer movement arose out of dissatisfaction of the
              consumers as many unfair practices were being indulged in by the
              sellers. There was no legal system available to consumers to
              protect them from exploitation in the marketplace. For a long
              time, when a consumer was not happy with a particular brand
              product or shop, he or she generally avoided buying that brand
              product, or would stop purchasing from that shop. It was presumed
              that it was the responsibility of consumers to be careful while
              buying a commodity or service. It took many years for
              organisations in India, and around the world, to create awareness
              amongst people. This has also shifted the responsibility of
              ensuring quality of goods and services on the sellers. In India,
              the consumer movement as a 'social force' originated with the
              necessity of protecting and promoting the interests of consumers
              against unethical and unfair trade practices. Rampant food
              shortages, hoarding, black marketing, adulteration of food and
              edible oil gave birth to the consumer movement in an organised
              form in the 1960s. Till the 1970s, consumer organisations were
              largely engaged in writing articles and holding exhibitions. They
              formed consumer groups to look into the malpractices in ration
              shops and overcrowding in the road passenger transport. More
              recently, India witnessed an upsurge in the number of consumer
              groups.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Consumers International -</b> In 1985 United Nations adopted
              the UN Guidelines for Consumer Protection. This was a tool for
              nations to adopt measures to protect consumers and for consumer
              advocacy groups to press their governments to do so. At the
              international level, this has become the foundation for consumer
              movement. Today, Consumers International has become an umbrella
              body to over 200 member organisations from over 100 countries.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because of all these efforts, the movement succeeded in bringing
              pressure on business firms as well as government to correct
              business conduct which may be unfair and against the interests of
              consumers at large. A major step taken in 1986 by the Indian
              government was the enactment of the Consumer Protection Act 1986,
              popularly known as COPRA. You will learn more about COPRA later.

                  <strong>Reji's Suffering -</strong><br />
                  Reji Mathew, a healthy boy studying in Class IX, was admitted in a private clinic in Kerala for removal of tonsils. An ENT surgeon performed the tonsillectomy operation under general anaesthesia. As a result of improper anaesthesia Reji showed symptoms of some brain abnormalities because of which he was crippled for life. His father filed a complaint in the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission claiming compensation of Rs 5,00,000 for medical negligence and deficiency, in service. The State Commission, saying that the evidence was not sufficient, dismissed it. Reji's father appealed again in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission located in New Delhi. The National Commission after looking into the complaint, held the hospital responsible for medical negligence and directed it to pay the compensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reji's suffering shows how a hospital, due to negligence by the doctors and staff in giving anaesthesia, crippled a student for life. While using many goods and services, we as consumers, have the right to be protected against the marketing of goods and delivery of services that are hazardous to life and property. Producers need to strictly follow the required safety rules and regulations. There are many goods and services that we purchase that require special attention to safety. For example, pressure cookers have a safety valve which, if it is defective, can cause a serious accident. The manufacturers of the safety valve have to ensure high quality. You also need public or government action to see that this quality is maintained. However, we do find bad quality products in the market because the supervision of these rules is weak and the consumer movement is also not strong enough.

                  When you buy any commodity, you will find certain details given on the packing. These details are about ingredients used, price, batch number, date of manufacture, expiry date and the address of the manufacturer. When we buy medicines, on the packets, you might find 'directions for proper use' and information relating to side effects and risks associated with usage of that medicine. When you buy garments, you will find information on 'instructions for washing'. Why is it that rules have been made so that the manufacturer displays this information? It is because consumers have the right to be informed about the particulars of goods and services that they purchase. Consumers can then complain and ask for compensation or replacement if the product proves to be defective in any manner. For example, if we buy a product and find it defective well within the expiry period, we can ask for a replacement. If the expiry period was not printed, the manufacturer would blame the shopkeeper and will not accept the responsibility. If people sell medicines that have expired severe action can be taken against them. Similarly, one can protest and complain if someone sells a good at more than the printed price on the packet. This is indicated by 'MRP' ‚Äî maximum retail price. In fact consumers can bargain with the seller to sell at less than the MRP.

                <p>
                  In recent times, the right to information has been expanded to cover various services provided by the Government. In October 2005, the Government of India enacted a law, popularly known as RTI (Right to Information) Act, which ensures its citizens all the information about the functions of government departments. The effect of the RTI Act can be understood from the following case.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Waiting...</strong><br />
                  Amritha, an engineering graduate after submitting all the certificates and attending the interview for a job in a government department, did not receive any news of the result. The officials also refused to comply with her queries. She therefore filed an application using the RTI Act saying that it was her right to know the result in a reasonable time so that she could plan her future. She was not only informed about the reasons for delay in the declaration of results but also got her call letter for appointment as she performed well in the interview.

                  <strong>A Refund -</strong><br />
                  Abirami, a student of Ansari Nagar, joined a two-year course at a local coaching institute for professional courses in New Delhi. At the time of joining the course, she paid the fees Rs 61,020 as lumpsum for the entire course of two years. However, she decided to opt out of the course at the end of one year as she found that the quality of teaching was not up to the mark. When she asked for a refund of the fee for one year, it was denied to her. When she filed the case in the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, the Commission directed the Institute to refund Rs 28,000 saying that she had the right to choose. The Institute again appealed in the State Consumer Commission. The State Commission upheld the District Commission's direction and further fined the institute Rs 25,000 for a frivolous appeal. It also directed the institute to pay Rs 7000 as compensation and litigation cost. The State Commission also restrained all the educational and professional institutions in the state from charging fees from students for the entire duration of the course in advance and that too at one go. Any violation of this order may invite penalties and imprisonment, the commission said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What do we understand from this incident? Any consumer who receives a service in whatever capacity, regardless of age, gender and nature of service, has the right to choose whether to continue to receive the service. Suppose you want to buy toothpaste, and the shop owner says that she can sell the toothpaste only if you buy a toothbrush. If you are not interested in buying the brush, your right to choice is denied. Similarly, sometimes gas supply dealers insist that you have to buy the stove from them when you take a new connection. In this way many a times you are forced to buy things that you may not wish to and you are left with no choice.

                  Read again the cases of Reji Mathew and Abirami given earlier in the chapter. These are some examples in which consumers are denied their rights. Such instances occur quite often in our country. Where should these consumers go to get justice? Consumers have the right to seek redressal against unfair trade practices and exploitation. If any damage is done to a consumer, she has the right to get compensation depending on the degree of damage. There is a need to provide an easy and effective public system by which this can be done. The consumer can file a complaint before the appropriate consumer forum on his/her own with or without the services of lawyers. You might be interested in knowing how an aggrieved person gets his or her compensation. Let us take the case of Prakash. He had sent a money-order to his village for his daughter's marriage. The money did not reach his daughter at the time when she needed it nor did it reach months later. Prakash filed a case in a district level Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in New Delhi. All the steps he undertook are illustrated here. These days consumer as an individual or as a group (called class action suit) file a complaint both Physically or through internet and conduct the case through video conferencing. The consumer movement in India has led to the formation of various organisations, locally known as consumer forums or consumer protection councils. They guide consumers on how to file cases in the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions. On many occasions, they also represent individual consumers in these commissions. These voluntary organisations also receive financial support from the government for creating awareness among people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are living in a residential colony, you might have noticed boards of Residents' Welfare Associations. If there is any unfair trade practice meted out to their members, they take up the case on their behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under COPRA, a three-tier quasi judicial machinery at the district, state and national levels was set up for redressal of consumer disputes. The district-level authority called District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission deals with the cases involving claims up to Rs 1 crore, the state-level Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions called State Commission between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore and the national-level commission ‚Äî National Commission ‚Äî deals with cases involving claims exceeding Rs 10 crore. If a case is dismissed in district-level commission, a consumer can also appeal in the state and then in national-level commissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, the Act has enabled us as consumers to have the right to represent in the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions.

                  When we as consumers become conscious of our rights, while purchasing various goods and services, we will be able to distinguish and make informed choices. This calls for acquiring the knowledge and skill to become a well-informed consumer. How do we become conscious of our rights? Look at the posters on the right and in the previous page. What do you think? The enactment of COPRA has led to the setting up of separate Departments of Consumer Affairs in central and state governments. The posters that you have seen are one example through which government spread information about legal process which people can use. You might also be seeing such advertisements on television channels.

                  While buying many commodities, on the cover, you might have seen a logo with the letters ISI, Agmark, Hallmark or +F. These logos and certification help consumers get assured of quality while purchasing the goods and services. The organisations that monitor and issue these certificates allow producers to use their logos provided they follow certain quality standards. Though these organisations develop quality standards for many products, it is not compulsory for all the producers to follow standards. However, for some products that affect the health and safety of consumers or of products of mass consumption like LPG cylinders, food colours and additives, cement, packaged drinking water, it is mandatory on the part of the producers to get certified by these organisations.

            <p>
              India has been observing 24 December as the National Consumers'
              Day. It was on this day that the Indian Parliament enacted the Consumer
              Protection Act in 1986. India is one of the countries that have exclusive
              authority for consumer redressal.
              The consumer movement in India
              has made some progress in terms of
              numbers of organised groups and  their activities. There are today more
              than 2000 consumer groups in the
              country of which only about 50-60
              are well organised and recognised for
              their work.
              However, the consumer redressal
              process is becoming cumbersome,
              expensive and time consuming. Many
              a time, consumers are required to
              engage lawyers. These cases require time for filing and attending the
              commission proceedings etc. In most
              purchases cash memos are not issued
              hence evidence is not easy to gather.
              Moreover most purchases in the
              market are small retail sales. The
              COPRA was amended in the year
              2019 to further strengthen
              consumers in India. Buying through
              internet is now included. If there is any
              service deficiency or defective product,
              service provider or manufacturer is
              also held responsible and would be
              penalized or even imprisoned.
              Settlement of disputes with the help
              of a neutral intermediary outside the
              Consumer Disputes Redressal
              Commission, called mediator, is now  encouraged at all the three tiers
              Consumer Commissions. After more
              than 30 years of the enactment of
              COPRA, consumer awareness in India
              is spreading but slowly. Besides this
              the enforcement of laws that protect
              workers, especially in the
              unorganised sectors is weak.
              Similarly, rules and regulations for
              working of markets are often not
              followed.
              Nevertheless, there is scope for
              consumers to realise their role and
              importance. It is often said that
              consumer movements can be effective
