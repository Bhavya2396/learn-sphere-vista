different levels of government is one of the major forms of power-sharing
in modern democracies. In this chapter, we focus on this form of power
sharing. It is most commonly referred to as federalism. We begin by
describing federalism in general terms. The rest of the chapter tries to
understand the theory and practice of federalism in India. A discussion
of the federal constitutional provisions is followed by an analysis of the
policies and politics that has strengthened federalism in practice. Towards
the end of the chapter, we turn to the local government, a new and third

                    <p> Let us get back to the contrast
between Belgium and Sri Lanka
that we saw in the last chapter. You
would recall that one of the key
changes made in the Constitution
of Belgium was to reduce the
power of the Central Government
and to give these powers to the
regional governments. Regional
governments existed in Belgium
even earlier. They had their roles
and powers. But all these powers
were given to these governments
and could be withdrawn by the
Central Government. The change
that took place in 1993 was that the
regional governments were given
constitutional powers that were
no longer dependent on the central
government. Thus, Belgium shifted
from a unitary to a federal form of
government. Sri Lanka continues  to be, for all practical purposes, a
unitary system where the national
government has all the powers.
Tamil leaders want Sri Lanka to
become a federal system.</p>

<p>Federalism is a system of
government in which the power is
divided between a central authority
and various constituent units of the
country. Usually, a federation has
two levels of government. One is the
government for the entire country
that is usually responsible for a
few subjects of common national
interest. The  others are governments
at the level of provinces or states
that look after much of the day
to-day administering of their state.
Both these levels of governments
enjoy their power independent of
the other.In this sense, federations are
contrasted with unitary governments.
Under the unitary system, either
there is only one level of government
or the sub-units are subordinate to
the central government. The central
government can pass on orders to the
provincial or the local government.
But in a federal system, the central
government cannot order the state
government to do something. State
government has powers of its own
for which it is not answerable
to the central government. Both
these governments are separately
answerable to the people.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Let us look at some of the key features of federalism :</p>

                    <p>1. There are two or more levels (or tiers) of government.</p>

                    <p>2. Different tiers of government govern the same citizens, but each tier has its own jurisdiction in specific matters of legislation, taxation and administration.</p>

                    <p>3. The jurisdictions of the respective levels or tiers of government are specified in the constitution. So the existence and authority of each tier of government is constitutionally guaranteed.</p>

                    <p>4. The fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed by one level of government. Such changes require the consent of both the levels of government.</p>

                    <p>5. Courts have the power to interpret the constitution and the powers of different levels of government. The highest court acts as an umpire if disputes arise between different levels of government in the exercise of their respective powers.</p>

                    <p>6. Sources of revenue for each level of government are clearly specified to ensure its financial autonomy.</p>

                    <p>7. The federal system thus has dual objectives: to safeguard and promote unity of the country, while at the same time accommodate regional diversity. Therefore, two aspects are crucial for the institutions and practice of federalism. Governments at different levels should agree to some rules of power-sharing. They should also trust that each would abide by its part of the agreement. An ideal federal system has both aspects : mutual trust and agreement to live together.</p>

                    <p>The exact balance of power between the central and the state government varies from one federation to another. This balance depends mainly on the historical context in which the federation was formed. There are two kinds of routes through which federations have been formed. The first route involves independent States coming together on their own to form a bigger unit, so that by pooling sovereignty and retaining identity, they can increase their security. This type of 'coming together' federations include the USA, Switzerland and Australia. In this first category of federations, all the constituent States usually have equal power and are strong vis-√†-vis the federal government.</p>

                    <p>The second route is where a large country decides to divide its power between the constituent States and the national government. India, Spain and Belgium are examples of this kind of 'holding together' federations. In this second category, the Central Government tends to be more powerful vis-√†-vis the States. Very often different constituent units of the federation have unequal powers. Some units are granted special powers.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>We have earlier seen how small
countries like Belgium and Sri Lanka
face so many problems of managing
diversity. What about a vast country
like India, with so many languages,
religions and regions? What are
the power sharing arrangements in
our country?</p>

<p> Let us begin with the Constitution.
India had emerged as an independent
nation after a painful and bloody
partition. Soon after Independence,
several princely states became a part
of the country. The Constitution
declared India as a Union of States.
Although it did not use the word
federation, the Indian Union is based
on the principles of federalism.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the seven
features of federalism mentioned
above. We can see that all these
features apply to the provisions
of the Indian Constitution. The
Constitution originally provided
for a two-tier system of government,
the Union Government or what
we call the Central Government,
representing the Union of India
and the State governments. Later,
a third tier of federalism was added in the form of Panchayats and
Municipalities. As in any federation,
these different tiers enjoy separate
jurisdiction.  The Constitution
clearly provided a three-fold
distribution of legislative powers
between the Union Government
and the State Governments. Thus,
it contains three lists:</p>

<p>1. Union List includes subjects
of national importance, such as
defence of the country, foreign
affairs, banking, communications
and currency. They are included
in this list because we need a
uniform policy on these matters
throughout the country. The Union
Government alone can make laws
relating to the subjects mentioned
in the Union List.</p>

<p>2. State List contains subjects
of State and local importance,
such as police, trade, commerce,
agriculture and irrigation. The State
Governments alone can make laws
relating to the subjects mentioned
in the State List.</p>

<p>3. Concurrent List includes
subjects of common interest to
both the Union Government as
well as the State Governments, such as education, forest, trade unions,
marriage, adoption and succession.
Both the Union as well as the State
Governments can make laws on
the subjects mentioned in this list.
If their laws conflict with each
other, the law made by the Union
Government will prevail.</p>

<p>What about subjects that do not
fall in any of the three lists? Or subjects
like computer software that came up
after the constitution was made?
According to our constitution, the
Union Government has the power to
legislate on these 'residuary' subjects.</p>

<p>We noted above that most
federations that are formed by
'holding together' do not give equal
power to its constituent units. Thus,
all States in the Indian Union do not
have identical powers. Some States
enjoy a special status. States such
as Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal
Pradesh and Mizoram enjoy special
powers under certain provisions of
the Constitution of India (Article
371) due to their peculiar social
and historical circumstances. These
special powers are especially enjoyed
in relation to the protection of
land rights of indigenous peoples,
their culture and also preferential
employment in government services.
Indians who are not permanent
residents of this State cannot buy
land or house here. Similar special
provisions exist for some other States
of India as well.</p>

<p> There are some units of the
Indian Union which enjoy very little
power. These are areas which are
too small to become an independent
State but which could not be merged
with any of the existing States.
These areas, like Chandigarh, or
Lakshadweep or the capital city of
Delhi, are called Union Territories.
These territories do not have the
powers of a State. The Central
Government has special powers in
running these areas.</p>

<p>This sharing of power between
the Union Government and the State
Governments is basic to the structure
of the Constitution. It is not easy to
make changes to this power sharing
arrangement. The Parliament cannot
on its own change this arrangement.
Any change to it has to be first passed
by both the Houses of Parliament
with at least two-thirds majority.
Then it has to be ratified by the
legislatures of at least half of the
total States.</p>

<p>The judiciary plays an important
role in overseeing the implementation
of constitutional provisions and
procedures. In case of any dispute
about the division of powers, the
High Courts and the Supreme Court
make a decision. The Union and
State Governments have the power
to raise resources by levying taxes in
order to carry on the government
and the responsibilities assigned to
each of them.</p>

                    <p>Constitutional provisions are necessary for the success of federalism but these are not sufficient. If the federal experiment has succeeded in India, it is not merely because of the clearly laid out constitutional provisions. The real success of federalism in India can be attributed to the nature of democratic politics in our country. This ensured that the spirit of federalism, respect for diversity and desire for living together became shared ideals in our country. Let us look at some of the major ways in which this happened.</p>

                            <p>The creation of linguistic States was the first and a major test for democratic politics in our country. If you look at the political map of India when it began its journey as a democracy in 1947 and that of 2019, you will be surprised by the extent of the changes. Many old States have vanished and many new States have been created. Areas, boundaries and names of the States have been changed.</p>
                            <p>In 1947, the boundaries of several old States of India were changed in order to create new States. This was done to ensure that people who spoke the same language lived in the same State. Some States were created not on the basis of language but to recognise differences based on culture, ethnicity or geography. These include States like Nagaland, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand.</p>
                            <p>When the demand for the formation of States on the basis of language was raised, some national leaders feared that it would lead to the disintegration of the country. The Central Government resisted linguistic States for some time. But the experience has shown that the formation of linguistic States has actually made the country more united. It has also made administration easier.</p>

                            <p>A second test for Indian federation is the language policy. Our Constitution did not give the status of national language to any one language. Hindi was identified as the official language. But Hindi is the mother tongue of only about 40 per cent of Indians. Therefore, there were many safeguards to protect other languages. Besides Hindi, there are 22 other languages recognised as Scheduled Languages by the Constitution.</p>
                            <p>A candidate in an examination conducted for the Central Government positions may opt to take the examination in any of these languages. States too have their own official languages. Much of the government work takes place in the official language of the concerned State.</p>
                            <p>Unlike Sri Lanka, the leaders of our country adopted a very cautious attitude in spreading the use of Hindi. According to the Constitution, the use of English for official purposes was to stop in 1965. However, many non-Hindi speaking States demanded that the use of English continue. In Tamil Nadu, this movement took a violent form. The Central Government responded by agreeing to continue the use of English along with Hindi for official purposes.</p>
                            <p>Many critics think that this solution favoured the English-speaking elite. Promotion of Hindi continues to be the official policy of the Government of India. Promotion does not mean that the Central Government can impose Hindi on States where people speak a different language. The flexibility shown by Indian political leaders helped our country avoid the kind of situation that Sri Lanka finds itself in.</p>

                            <p>Restructuring the Centre-State relations is one more way in which federalism has been strengthened in practice. How the constitutional arrangements for sharing power work in reality depends to a large extent on how the ruling parties and leaders follow these arrangements.</p>
                            <p>For a long time, the same party ruled both at the Centre and in most of the States. This meant that the State Governments did not exercise their rights as autonomous federal units. As and when the ruling party at the State level was different, the parties that ruled at the Centre tried to undermine the power of the States.</p>
                            <p>In those days, the Central Government would often misuse the Constitution to dismiss the State Governments that were controlled by rival parties. This undermined the spirit of federalism.</p>
                            <p>All this changed significantly after 1990. This period saw the rise of regional political parties in many States of the country. This was also the beginning of the era of coalition governments at the Centre. Since no single party got a clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the major national parties had to enter into an alliance with many parties including several regional parties to form a government at the Centre.</p>
                            <p>This led to a new culture of power sharing and respect for the autonomy of State Governments. This trend was supported by a major judgement of the Supreme Court that made it difficult for the Central Government to dismiss state governments in an arbitrary manner. Thus, federal power sharing is more effective today than it was in the early years after the Constitution came into force.</p>

                            <p>How many languages do we have in India? The answer depends on how one counts it. The latest information that we have is from the Census of India held in 2011. This census recorded more than 1300 distinct languages which people mentioned as their mother tongues. These languages were grouped together under some major languages.</p>
                            <p>For example, languages like Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Bundelkhandi, Chhattisgarhi, Rajasthani and many others were grouped together under 'Hindi'. Even after this grouping, the Census found 121 major languages. Of these, 22 languages are now included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution and are therefore called 'Scheduled Languages'. Others are called 'non-Scheduled Languages'. In terms of languages, India is perhaps the most diverse country in the world.</p>
                            <p>A look at the enclosed table makes it clear that no one language is the mother tongue of the majority of our population. The largest language, Hindi, is the mother tongue of only about 44 per cent Indians. If we add to that all those who knew Hindi as their second or third language, the total number was still less than 50 per cent in 2011.</p>
                            <p>As for English, only 0.02 per cent Indians recorded it as their mother tongue. Another 11 per cent knew it as a second or third language.</p>

                </h2>

                <div class="content-block">
                     <p>We noted above that federal governments have two or more tiers of governments. We have so far discussed the two-tiers of government in our country. But a vast country like India cannot be run only through these two-tiers. States in India are as large as independent countries of Europe. In terms of population, Uttar Pradesh is bigger than Russia, Maharashtra is about as big as Germany. Many of these States are internally very diverse. There is thus a need for power sharing within these States.</p>

<p>Federal power sharing in India needs another tier of government, below that of the State governments. This is the rationale for decentralisation of power. Thus, resulted a third tier of government, called local government.</p>

<p>When power is taken away from Central and State governments and given to local government, it is called decentralisation. The basic idea behind decentralisation is that there are a large number of problems and issues which are best settled at the local level. People have better knowledge of problems in their localities. They also have better ideas on where to spend money and how to manage things more efficiently.</p>

<p>Besides, at the local level it is possible for the people to directly participate in decision making. This helps to inculcate a habit of democratic participation. Local government is the best way to realise one important principle of democracy, namely local self-government.</p>

<p>The need for decentralisation was recognised in our Constitution. Since then, there have been several attempts to decentralise power to the level of villages and towns. Panchayats in villages and municipalities in urban areas were set up in all the States. But these were directly under the control of state governments. Elections to these local governments were not held regularly. Local governments did not have any powers or resources of their own. Thus, there was very little decentralisation in effective terms.</p>

<p>A major step towards decentralisation was taken in 1992. The Constitution was amended to make the third-tier of democracy more powerful and effective.</p>

<p>a) Now it is constitutionally mandatory to hold regular elections to local government bodies.</p>

<p>b) Seats are reserved in the elected bodies and the executive heads of these institutions for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.</p>

<p>c) At least one-third of all positions are reserved for women.</p>

<p>d) An independent institution called the State Election Commission has been created in each State to conduct panchayat and municipal elections.</p>

<p>e) The State governments are required to share some powers and revenue with local government bodies. The nature of sharing varies from State to State.</p>

<p>Rural local government is popularly known by the name panchayati raj. Each village, or a group of villages in some States, has a gram panchayat. This is a council consisting of several ward members, often called panch, and a president or sarpanch. They are directly elected by all the adult population living in that ward or village. It is the decision-making body for the entire village.</p>

<p>The panchayat works under the overall supervision of the gram sabha. All the voters in the village are its members. It has to meet at least twice or thrice in a year to approve the annual budget of the gram panchayat and to review the performance of the gram panchayat.</p>

<p>The local government structure goes right up to the district level. A few gram panchayats are grouped together to form what is usually called a panchayat samiti or block or mandal. The members of this representative body are elected by all the panchyat members in that area. All the panchayat samitis or mandals in a district together constitute the zilla (district) parishad.</p>

<p>Most members of the zilla parishad are elected. Members of the Lok Sabha and MLAs of that district and some other officials of other district level bodies are also its members. Zilla parishad chairperson is the political head of the zilla parishad.</p>

<p>Similarly, local government bodies exist for urban areas as well. Municipalities are set up in towns. Big cities are constituted into municipal corporations. Both municipalities and municipal corporations are controlled by elected bodies consisting of people's representatives. Municipal chairperson is the political head of the municipality. In a municipal corporation, such an officer is called the mayor.</p>

<p>An experiment in Brazil: A city called Porto Alegre in Brazil has carried out an extraordinary experiment in combining decentralisation with participative democracy. The city has set up a parallel organisation operating alongside the municipal council, enabling local inhabitants to take real decisions for their city. The nearly 13 lakh people in this city get to participate in making the budget for their own city.</p>

<p>The city is divided into many sectors or what we call wards. Each sector has a meeting, like that of the gram sabha, in which anyone living in that area can participate. There are some meetings to discuss issues that affect the entire city. Any citizen of the city can participate in those meetings. The budget of the city is discussed in these meetings. The proposals are put to the municipality that takes a final decision about it.</p>

<p>About 20,000 people participate in this decision making exercise every year. This method has ensured that the money cannot be spent only for the benefit of the colonies where rich people live. Buses now run to the poor colonies and builders cannot evict slum-dwellers without resettling them.</p>

<p>In our own country, a similar experiment has taken place in some areas in Kerala. Ordinary people have participated in making a plan for the development of their locality.</p>

<p>This new system of local government is the largest experiment in democracy conducted anywhere in the world. There are now about 36 lakh elected representatives in the panchayats and municipalities etc., all over the country. This number is bigger than the population of many countries in the world.</p>

<p>Constitutional status for local government has helped to deepen democracy in our country. It has also increased women's representation and voice in our democracy. At the same time, there are many difficulties. While elections are held regularly and enthusiastically, gram sabhas are not held regularly. Most state governments have not transferred significant powers to the local governments. Nor have they given adequate resources. We are thus still a long way from realising the ideal of self-government.</p>
