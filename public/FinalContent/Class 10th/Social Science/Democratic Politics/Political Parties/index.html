This chapter explores the essential role parties play‚Äîfrom contesting elections to forming governments and representing diverse interests. It discusses why political parties are necessary, how many parties a democracy needs, and examines both national and regional parties in India. The chapter also highlights the challenges faced by political parties and suggests ways to make them more effective and democratic.</p>

                    <p> In this tour of democracy, we have come across political parties several
times. In Class IX, we noticed the role of political parties in the rise of
democracies, in the formation of constitutional designs, in electoral politics
and in the making and working of governments. In this textbook, we have
glanced at political parties as vehicles of federal sharing of political power
and as negotiators of social divisions in the arena of democratic politics.
Before concluding this tour, let us take a close look at the nature and
working of political parties, especially in our country. We begin by asking
two common questions: Why do we need parties? How many parties are
good for a democracy? In the light of these, we introduce the national
and regional political parties in today's India and then look at what is
wrong with political parties and what can be done about it.</p>

                    <p>Political parties are easily one of the most visible institutions in a democracy. For most ordinary citizens, democracy is equal to political parties. If you travel to remote parts of our country and speak to the less educated citizens, you could come across people who may not know anything about our Constitution or about the nature of our government. But chances are that they would know something about our political parties.</p>

<p>At the same time, this visibility does not mean popularity. Most people tend to be very critical of political parties. They tend to blame parties for all that is wrong with our democracy and our political life. Parties have become identified with social and political divisions.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is natural to ask ‚Äì do we need political parties at all? About hundred years ago, there were few countries of the world that had any political party. Now there are few that do not have parties. Why did political parties become so omnipresent in democracies all over the world? Let us first answer what political parties are and what they do, before we say why we need them.</p>

                            <p>A political party is a group of people who come together to contest elections and hold power in the government. They agree on some policies and programmes for the society with a view to promote the collective good. Since there can be different views on what is good for all, parties try to persuade people why their policies are better than others. They seek to implement these policies by winning popular support through elections.</p>

<p>Thus, parties reflect fundamental political divisions in a society. Parties are about a part of the society and thus, involve partisanship. Thus, a party is known by which part it stands for, which policies it supports and whose interests it upholds. A political party has three components: 1) the leaders, 2) the active members and 3) the followers</p>

                            <p>What does a political party do? Basically, political parties fill political offices and exercise political power. Parties do so by performing a series of functions:</p>

<p>1. Parties contest elections. In most democracies, elections are fought mainly among the candidates put up by political parties. Parties select their candidates in different ways. In some countries, such as the USA, members and supporters of a party choose its candidates. Now more and more countries are following this method. In other countries like India, top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections.</p>

<p>2. Parties put forward different policies and programmes and the voters choose from them. Each of us may have different opinions and views on what policies are suitable for the society. But no government can handle such a large variety of views. In a democracy, a large number of similar opinions have to be grouped together to provide a direction in which policies can be formulated by the governments. This is what the parties do. A party reduces a vast multitude of opinions into a few basic positions which it supports. A government is expected to base its policies on the line taken by the ruling party.</p>

<p>3. Parties play a decisive role in making laws for a country. Formally, laws are debated and passed in the legislature. But since most of the members belong to a party, they go by the direction of the party leadership, irrespective of their personal opinions.</p>

<p>4. Parties form and run governments. As we noted last year, the big policy decisions are taken by political executive that comes from the political parties. Parties recruit leaders, train them and then make them ministers to run the government in the way they want.</p>

<p>5. Those parties that lose in the elections play the role of opposition to the parties in power, by voicing different views and criticising government for its failures or wrong policies. Opposition parties also mobilise opposition to the government.</p>

<p>6. Parties shape public opinion. They raise and highlight issues. Parties have lakhs of members and activists spread all over the country. Many of the pressure groups are the extensions of political parties among different sections of society. Parties sometimes also launch movements for the resolution of problems faced by people. Often opinions in the society crystallise on the lines parties take.</p>

<p>7. Parties provide people access to government machinery and welfare schemes implemented by governments. For an ordinary citizen it is easy to approach a local party leader than a government officer. That is why, they feel close to parties even when they do not fully trust them. Parties have to be responsive to people‚Äôs needs and demands. Otherwise people can reject those parties in the next elections.</p>

                            <p>This list of functions in a sense answers the question asked above: we need political parties because they perform all these functions. But we still need to ask why modern democracies cannot exist without political parties. We can understand the necessity of political parties by imagining a situation without parties. Every candidate in the elections will be independent. So no one will be able to make any promises to the people about any major policy changes. The government may be formed, but its utility will remain ever uncertain. Elected representatives will be accountable to their constituency for what they do in the locality. But no one will be responsible for how the country will be run.</p>

<p>We can also think about it by looking at the non-party based elections to the panchayat in many states. Although, the parties do not contest formally, it is generally noticed that the village gets split into more than one faction, each of which puts up a 'panel' of its candidates. This is exactly what the party does. That is the reason we find political parties in almost all countries of the world, whether these countries are big or small, old or new, developed or developing.</p>

<p>The rise of political parties is directly linked to the emergence of representative democracies. As we have seen, large societies need representative democracy. As societies became large and complex, they also needed some agency to gather different views on various issues and to present these to the government. They needed some ways, to bring various representatives together so that a responsible government could be formed. They needed a mechanism to support or restrain the government, make policies, justify or oppose them. Political parties fulfill these needs that every representative government has. We can say that parties are a necessary condition for a democracy.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>In a democracy any group of citizens
is free to form a political party. In
this formal sense, there are a large
number of political parties in each
country. More than 750 parties
are registered with the Election
Commission of India. But not all
these parties are serious contenders
in the elections. Usually only a
handful of parties are effectively in the race to win elections and form
the government. So the question is:
how many major or effective parties
are good for a democracy?</p>

<p>In some countries, only one
party is allowed to control and run
the government. These are called
one-party systems. In Class IX,
we noted that in China, only the
Communist Party is allowed to rule. Although, legally speaking,
people are free to form political
parties, it does not happen because
the electoral system does not permit
free competition for power. We
cannot consider one-party system as
a good option because this is not a
democratic option. Any democratic
system must allow at least two parties
to compete in elections and provide a
fair chance for the competing parties
to come to power.</p>

<p>In some countries, power usually
changes between two main parties.
Several other parties may exist,
contest elections and win a few seats
in the national legislatures. But only
the two main parties have a serious
chance of winning majority of seats
to form government. Such a party
system is called two-party system.
The United States of America and
the United Kingdom are examples
of two-party system.</p>

<p>If several parties compete for
power, and more than two parties
have a reasonable chance of coming
to power either on their own strength
or in alliance with others, we call it
a multiparty system. Thus in India,
we have a multiparty system. In this
system, the government is formed by
various parties coming together in a coalition. When several parties in a
multi-party system join hands for the
purpose of contesting elections and
winning power, it is called an alliance
or a front. For example, in India
there were three such major alliances
in 2004 parliamentary elections‚Äì the
National Democratic Alliance, the
United Progressive Alliance and the
Left Front. The multiparty system
often appears very messy and leads
to political instability. At the same
time, this system allows a variety
of interests and opinions to enjoy
political representation.</p>

<p>So, which of these is better?
Perhaps the best answer to this very
common question is that this is not
a very good question. Party system
is not something any country can
choose. It evolves over a long time,
depending on the nature of society,
its social and regional divisions, its
history of politics and its system of
elections. These cannot be changed
very quickly. Each country develops a
party system that is conditioned by its
special circumstances. For example, if
India has evolved a multiparty system,
it is because the social and geographical
diversity in such a large country is
not easily absorbed by two or even
three parties. No system is ideal for all
countries and all situations.</p>

<p><strong>Popular participation in political parties</strong></p>

<p>It is often said that political parties are facing a
crisis because they are very unpopular and the
citizens are indifferent to political parties. The
available evidence shows that this belief is only
partly true for India. The evidence, based on a series of large
sample surveys conducted over several decades, shows that:</p>

<p>1) Political parties do not enjoy much trust among the people in
South Asia. The proportion of those who say their trust in political
parties is 'not much' or 'not at all' is more than those who have
'some' or 'great' trust.</p>

<p>2) The same is true of most other democracies as well. Political
parties are one of the least trusted institutions all over the world.</p>

<p>3) Yet the level of participation in the activities of political parties
was fairly high. The proportion of those who said they were
members of some political party was higher in India than many
advanced countries like Canada, Japan, Spain and South Korea.</p>

<p>4) Over the last three decades, the proportion of those who
report to be members of
political parties in India has
gone up steadily.</p>

<p>5) The proportion of those
who say they feel 'close to
a political party' has also
gone up in India in this
period.</p>

                    <p>Democracies that follow a federal
system all over the world tend to
have two kinds of political parties:
parties that are present in only one of
the federal units and parties that are
present in several or all units of the
federation. This is the case in India
as well. There are some country-wide
parties, which are called 'national
parties'. These parties have their
units in various states. But by and
large, all these units follow the same
policies, programmes and strategy
that is decided at the national level.
Every party in the country
has to register with the Election
Commission. While the Commission
treats all parties equally, it offers
some special facilities to large and
established parties.  These parties
are given a unique symbol ‚Äì only
the official candidates of that party
can use that election symbol. Parties
that get this privilege and some other special facilities are 'recognised' by
the Election Commission for this
purpose. That is why these parties
are called, 'recognised political
parties'. The Election Commission
has laid down detailed criteria of
the proportion of votes and seats
that a party must get in order to
be a recognised party. A party that
secures at least six per cent of the
total votes in an election to the
Legislative Assembly of a State and
wins at least two seats is recognised
as a State party. A party that secures
at least six per cent of the total votes
in Lok Sabha elections or Assembly
elections in four States and wins at
least four seats in the Lok Sabha is
recognised as a national party.  According to this classification,
there are six recognized national
parties in the country as per
notification of the Election
Commission of India issued in 2023.</p>

        Front and Telangana Rashtra Samithi
        are conscious about their State identity. Over the last three decades, the
        number and strength of these parties has
        expanded. This made the Parliament
        of India politically more and more
        diverse. No one national party is able
        to secure on its own a majority in the
        Lok Sabha, until 2014. As a result, the
        national parties are compelled to form
        alliances with State parties. Since 1996,
        nearly every one of the State parties has
        got an opportunity to be a part of one
        or the other national level coalition
        government. This has contributed to
        the strengthening of federalism and
        democracy in our country. (See the
        map below for details of
        these parties).</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>We have seen how crucial political parties are for the working of democracy. Since parties are the most visible face of democracy, it is natural that people blame parties for whatever is wrong with the working of democracy. All over the world, people express strong dissatisfaction with the failure of political parties to perform their functions well. This is the case in our country too. Popular dissatisfaction and criticism has focussed on four problem areas in the working of political parties. Political parties need to face and overcome these challenges in order to remain effective instruments of democracy.</p>

                    <p>The first challenge is lack of internal democracy within parties. All over the world there is a tendency in political parties towards the concentration of power in one or few leaders at the top. Parties do not keep membership registers, do not hold organisational meetings, and do not conduct internal elections regularly. Ordinary members of the party do not get sufficient information on what happens inside the party. They do not have the means or the connections needed to influence the decisions. As a result, the leaders assume greater power to make decisions in the name of the party. Since one or few leaders exercise paramount power in the party, those who disagree with the leadership find it difficult to continue in the party. More than loyalty to party principles and policies, personal loyalty to the leader becomes more important.</p>

                    <p>The second challenge of dynastic succession is related to the first one. Since most political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their functioning, there are very few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top in a party. Those who happen to be the leaders are in a position of unfair advantage to favour people close to them or even their family members. In many parties, the top positions are always controlled by members of one family. This is unfair to other members of that party. This is also bad for democracy, since people who do not have adequate experience or popular support come to occupy positions of power. This tendency is present in some measure all over the world, including in some of the older democracies.</p>

                    <p>The third challenge is about the growing role of money and muscle power in parties, especially during elections. Since parties are focussed only on winning elections, they tend to use short-cuts to win elections. They tend to nominate those candidates who have or can raise lots of money. Rich people and companies who give funds to the parties tend to have influence on the policies and decisions of the party. In some cases, parties support criminals who can win elections. Democrats all over the world are worried about the increasing role of rich people and big companies in democratic politics.</p>

                    <p>The fourth challenge is that very often parties do not seem to offer a meaningful choice to the voters. In order to offer meaningful choice, parties must be significantly different. In recent years, there has been a decline in the ideological differences among parties in most parts of the world. For example, the difference between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party in Britain is very little. They agree on more fundamental aspects but differ only in details on how policies are to be framed and implemented. In our country too, the differences among all the major parties on the economic policies have reduced. Those who want really different policies have no option available to them. Sometimes people cannot even elect very different leaders either, because the same set of leaders keep shifting from one party to another.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>In order to face these challenges, political parties need to be reformed. The question is: Are political parties willing to reform? If they are willing, what has prevented them from reforming so far? If they are not willing, is it possible to force them to reform? Citizens all over the world face this question. This is not a simple question to answer. In a democracy, the final decision is made by leaders who represent political parties. People can replace them, but only by another set of party leaders. If all of them do not wish to reform, how can anyone force them to change?</p>

                    <p>Let us look at some of the recent efforts and suggestions in our country to reform political parties and its leaders:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. The Constitution was amended to prevent elected MLAs and MPs from changing parties.</strong> This was done because many elected representatives were indulging in defection in order to become ministers or for cash rewards. Now the law says that if any MLA or MP changes parties, he or she will lose the seat in the legislature. This new law has helped bring defection down. At the same time, this has made any dissent even more difficult. MPs and MLAs have to accept whatever the party leaders decide.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. The Supreme Court passed an order to reduce the influence of money and criminals.</strong> Now, it is mandatory for every candidate who contests elections to file an affidavit giving details of his property and criminal cases pending against him. The new system has made a lot of information available to the public. But there is no system to check if the information given by the candidates is true. As yet we do not know if it has led to decline in the influence of the rich and the criminals.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. The Election Commission passed an order making it necessary for political parties to hold their organisational elections and file their income tax returns.</strong> The parties have started doing so but sometimes it is mere formality. It is not clear if this step has led to greater internal democracy in political parties.</p>

                    <p>Besides these, many suggestions are often made to reform political parties:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. A law should be made to regulate the internal affairs of political parties.</strong> It should be made compulsory for political parties to maintain a register of its members, to follow its own constitution, to have an independent authority, to act as a judge in case of party disputes, to hold open elections to the highest posts.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. It should be made mandatory for political parties to give a minimum number of tickets, about one-third, to women candidates.</strong> Similarly, there should be a quota for women in the decision making bodies of the party.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. There should be state funding of elections.</strong> The government should give parties money to support their election expenses. This support could be given in kind: petrol, paper, telephone, etc. Or it could be given in cash on the basis of the votes secured by the party in the last election.</p>

                    <p>These suggestions have not yet been accepted by political parties. If and when these are accepted these could lead to some improvement. But we must be very careful about legal solutions to political problems. Over-regulation of political parties can be counter-productive. This would force all parties to find ways to cheat the law. Besides, political parties will not agree to pass a law that they do not like.</p>

                    <p>There are two other ways in which political parties can be reformed. <strong>One, people can put pressure on political parties.</strong> This can be done through petitions, publicity and agitations. Ordinary citizens, pressure groups and movements and the media can play an important role in this. If political parties feel that they would lose public support by not taking up reforms, they would become more serious about reforms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Two, political parties can improve if those who want this, join political parties.</strong> The quality of democracy depends on the degree of public participation. It is difficult to reform politics if ordinary citizens do not take part in it and simply criticise it from the outside. The problem of bad politics can be solved by more and better politics. We shall return to this theme in the final chapter.</p>

                                    <h4>Q6. Read the following passage and answer the questions given below: Muhammad Yunus is a famous economist of Bangladesh. He received several international honours for his efforts to promote economic and social development for the benefit of the poor. He and the Grameen Bank that he started jointly, received the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 2006. In February 2007, he decided to launch a political party and contest in the parliamentary elections. His objective was to foster proper leadership, good governance and build a new Bangladesh. He felt that only a political party different from the traditional ones would bring about new political culture. His party would be democratic from the grassroots level. The launching of the new party, called Nagarik Shakti (Citizens' Power), has caused a stir among the Bangladeshis. While many welcomed his decision, some did not like it. "Now I think Bangladesh will have a chance to choose between good and bad and eventually have a good government," said Shahedul Islam, a government official. "That government, we hope, would not only keep itself away from corruption but also make fighting corruption and black money a top priority." But leaders of traditional political parties who dominated the country's politics for decades were apprehensive. "There was no debate (over him) winning the Nobel, but politics is different ‚Äì very challenging and often controversial," said a senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Some others were highly critical. They asked why he was rushing into politics. "Is he being planted in politics by mentors from outside the country," asked one political observer. Do you think Yunus made a right decision to float a new political party? Do you agree with the statements and fears expressed by various people? How do you want this new party organised to make it different from other parties? If you were the one to begin this political party, how would you defend it?</h4>
