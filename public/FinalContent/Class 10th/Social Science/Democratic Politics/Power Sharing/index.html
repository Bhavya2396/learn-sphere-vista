                    <p>This chapter continues the exploration of democracy by focusing on the concept of power-sharing ‚Äî a key feature that ensures no single organ of government holds all the power. Through the examples of Belgium and Sri Lanka, it explains how democracies manage diverse social and political demands by distributing power among different groups and institutions. Understanding power-sharing helps us appreciate its importance in maintaining balance, unity, and stability within a democratic system.</p>

                    <p> With this chapter, we resume the tour of democracy that we started last
year. We noted last year that in a democracy all power does not rest
with any one organ of the government. An intelligent sharing of power
among legislature, executive and judiciary is very important to the design
of a democracy. In this and the next two chapters, we carry this idea of
power-sharing forward. We start with two stories from Belgium and Sri
Lanka. Both these stories are about how democracies handle demands for
power-sharing. The stories yield some general conclusions about the need
for power-sharing in democracy.  This allows us to discuss various forms
of power-sharing that will be taken up in the following two chapters.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p> Belgium is a small country in Europe,
smaller in area than the state of
Haryana. It has borders with France,
the Netherlands, Germany and
Luxembourg. It has a population of
a little over one crore, about half the
population of Haryana. The ethnic
composition of this small country is
very complex. Of the country's total
population, 59 per cent lives in the
Flemish region and speaks Dutch
language. Another 40 per cent people
live in the Wallonia region and speak
French. Remaining one per cent of
the Belgians speak German. In the
capital city Brussels, 80 per cent
people speak French while 20 per
cent are Dutch-speaking.
 The minority French-speaking
community was relatively rich and
powerful. This was resented by the
Dutch-speaking community who got
the benefit of economic development
and education much later. This led  to tensions between the Dutch
speaking and French-speaking
communities during the 1950s and
1960s. The tension between the
two communities was more acute
in Brussels. Brussels presented a
special problem: the Dutch-speaking
people constituted a majority in
the country, but a minority in the
capital.
Let us compare this to the
situation in another country. Sri
Lanka is an island nation, just a few
kilometres off the southern coast
of Tamil Nadu. It has about two
crore people, about the same as in
Haryana. Like other nations in the
South Asia region, Sri Lanka has a
diverse population. The major social
groups are the Sinhala-speakers (74
per cent) and the Tamil-speakers (18
per cent). Among Tamils there are
two sub-groups. Tamil natives of
the country are called 'Sri Lankan Tamils' (13 per cent). The rest,
whose forefathers came from India as
plantation workers during colonial
period, are called 'Indian Tamils'.
As you can see from the map,  Sri
Lankan Tamils are concentrated in
the north and east of the country.
Most of the Sinhala-speaking people
are Buddhists, while most of the
Tamils are Hindus or Muslims. There
are about 7 per cent Christians, who
are both Tamil and Sinhala.
Just imagine what could happen
in situations like this. In Belgium, the Dutch community could take
advantage of its numeric majority
and force its will on the French and
German-speaking population. This
would push the conflict among
communities further. This could
lead to a very messy partition of the
country; both the sides would claim
control over Brussels. In Sri Lanka,
the Sinhala community enjoyed
an even bigger majority and could
impose its will on the entire country.
Now, let us look at what happened
in both these countries.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>  Sri Lanka emerged as an independent
country in 1948. The leaders of
the Sinhala community sought to
secure dominance over government
by virtue of their majority. As a
result, the democratically elected
government adopted a series of
majoritarian measures to establish
Sinhala supremacy.
 In 1956, an Act was passed
to recognise Sinhala as the only
official language, thus disregarding
Tamil. The governments followed
preferential policies that favoured
Sinhala applicants for university
positions and government jobs. A
new constitution stipulated that
the state shall protect and foster
Buddhism.
 All these government measures,
coming one after the other, gradually
increased the feeling of alienation
among the Sri Lankan Tamils.
They felt that none of the major
political parties led by the Buddhist
Sinhala leaders was sensitive to their language and culture. They felt that
the constitution and government
policies denied them equal political
rights, discriminated against them in
getting jobs and other opportunities
and ignored their interests. As a  result, the relations between the
Sinhala and Tamil communities
strained over time.
The Sri Lankan Tamils launched
parties and struggles for the recognition
of Tamil as an official language, for
regional autonomy and equality of
opportunity in securing education
and jobs. But their demand for more
autonomy to provinces populated by the
Tamils was repeatedly denied. By 1980s,
several political organisations were
formed demanding an independent Tamil Eelam (state) in northern and
eastern parts of Sri Lanka.
The distrust between the two
communities turned into widespread
conflict. It soon turned into a civil
war. As a result thousands of people
of both the communities have been
killed. Many families were forced to
leave the country as refugees and many
more lost their livelihoods. The civil
war has caused a terrible setback to the
social, cultural and economic life of the
country. It ended in 2009. </p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p> The Belgian leaders took a different
path. They recognised the existence
of regional differences and cultural
diversities. Between 1970 and 1993,
they amended their constitution four
times so as to work out an arrangement
that would enable everyone to live
together within the same country.
The arrangement they worked out is
different from any other country and is
very innovative. Here are some of the
elements of the Belgian model:
a) Constitution prescribes that the
number of Dutch and French-speaking
ministers shall be equal in the central
government. Some special laws require  the support of majority of members
from each linguistic group. Thus, no
single community can make decisions
unilaterally.
b) Many powers of the Central
Government have been given to State
Governments of the two regions of
the country. The State Governments
are not subordinate to the Central
Government.

c) Brussels has a separate government
in which both the communities have
equal representation. The French
speaking people accepted equal
representation in Brussels because
the Dutch-speaking community has
accepted equal representation in the accepted equal representation in the
Central Government.

d)  Apart from the Central and
the State Government, there is a
third kind of government. This
'community government' is elected
by people belonging to one language
community ‚Äì Dutch, French and
German-speaking ‚Äì no matter where
they live. This government has the
power regarding cultural, educational
and language-related issues.


 You might find the Belgian model
very complicated. It indeed is very
complicated, even for people living
in Belgium. But these arrangements
have worked well so far. They helped
to avoid civic strife between the two
major communities and a possible
division of the country on linguistic
lines. When many countries of  Europe came together to form the
European Union, Brussels was
chosen as its headquarters.


 What do we learn from these two
stories of Belgium and Sri Lanka?
Both are democracies. Yet, they
dealt with the question of power
sharing differently. In Belgium,
the leaders have realised that the
unity of the country is possible
only by respecting the feelings and
interests of different communities and regions. Such a realisation
resulted in mutually acceptable
arrangements for sharing power.
Sri Lanka shows us a contrasting
example. It shows us that if a
majority community wants to
force its dominance over others
and refuses to share power, it can
undermine the unity of the country.</p>

                            <p>Thus, two different sets of reasons can be given in favour of power sharing. Firstly, power sharing is good because it helps to reduce the possibility of conflict between social groups. Since social conflict often leads to violence and political instability, power sharing is a good way to ensure the stability of political order. Imposing the will of majority community over others may look like an attractive option in the short run, but in the long run it undermines the unity of the nation. Tyranny of the majority is not just oppressive for the minority; it often affects majority adversely as well.</p>
                            <p>There is a second, deeper reason why power sharing is good for democracies. Power sharing is the very spirit of democracy. A democratic rule involves sharing power with those affected by its exercise, and who have to live with its effects. People have a right to be consulted on how they are to be governed. A legitimate government is one where citizens, through participation, acquire a stake in the system.</p>
                            <p>Let us call the first set of reasons prudential and the second moral. While prudential reasons stress that power sharing will bring out better outcomes, moral reasons emphasise the very act of power sharing as valuable.</p>

They lived together, intermingled, yet fought a bitter civil war among themselves. One of Khalil's uncles was killed in that war.</p>
                            <p> At the end of this civil war, Lebanon's leaders came together and agreed to some basic rules for power sharing among different communities. As per these rules, the country's President must belong to the Maronite sect of Catholic Christians. The Prime Minister must be from the Sunni Muslim community. The post of Deputy Prime Minister is fixed for Orthodox Christian sect and that of the Speaker for Shi'a Muslims. Under this pact, the Christians agreed not to seek French protection and the Muslims agreed not to seek unification with the neighbouring state of Syria.When the Christians and Muslims came to this agreement, they were nearly equal in population. Both sides have continued to respect this agreement though now the Muslims are in clear majority.</p>
                            <p>Khalil does not like this system one bit. He is a popular man with political ambition. But under the present system, the top position is out of his reach. He does not practise either his father's or his mother's religion and does not wish to be known by either. He cannot understand why Lebanon can't be like any other 'normal' democracy. "Just hold an election, allow everyone to contest and whoever wins maximum votes becomes the president, no matter which community he comes from. Why can't we do that, like in other democracies of the world?" he asks. His elders, who have seen the bloodshed of the civil war, tell him that the present system is the best guarantee for peace..."</p>
                            <p> The story was not finished, but they had reached the TV tower where they stopped every day. Vetal wrapped up quickly and posed his customary question to Vikram: "If you had the power to rewrite the rules in Lebanon, what would you do? Would you adopt the 'regular' rules followed everywhere, as Khalil suggests? Or stick to the old rules? Or do something else?" Vetal did not forget to remind Vikram of their basic pact: "If you have an answer in mind and yet do not speak up, your mobike will freeze, and so will you!"</p>
                            <p> Can you help poor Vikram in answering Vetal?</p>

                    <p>The idea of power-sharing has emerged in opposition to the notions of undivided political power. For a long time, it was believed that all power of a government must reside in one person or group of persons located at one place. It was felt that if the power to decide is dispersed, it would not be possible to take quick decisions and to enforce them.</p>

                    <p>But these notions have changed with the emergence of democracy. One basic principle of democracy is that people are the source of all political power. In a democracy, people rule themselves through institutions of self-government. In a good democratic government, due respect is given to diverse groups and views that exist in a society. Everyone has a voice in the shaping of public policies. Therefore, it follows that in a democracy, political power should be distributed among as many citizens as possible.</p>

                    <p>In modern democracies, power sharing arrangements can take many forms. Let us look at some of the most common arrangements that we have or will come across.</p>

                            <p>Power is shared among different organs of government, such as the legislature, executive and judiciary. Let us call this horizontal distribution of power because it allows different organs of government placed at the same level to exercise different powers. Such a separation ensures that none of the organs can exercise unlimited power. Each organ checks the others. This results in a balance of power among various institutions.</p>
                            <p>Last year, we studied that in a democracy, even though ministers and government officials exercise power, they are responsible to the Parliament or State Assemblies. Similarly, although judges are appointed by the executive, they can check the functioning of executive or laws made by the legislatures. This arrangement is called a system of checks and balances.</p>

                            <p>Power can be shared among governments at different levels ‚Äì a general government for the entire country and governments at the provincial or regional level. Such a general government for the entire country is usually called federal government. In India, we refer to it as the Central or Union Government.</p>
                            <p>The governments at the provincial or regional level are called by different names in different countries. In India, we call them State Governments. This system is not followed in all countries. There are many countries where there are no provincial or state governments.</p>
                            <p>But in those countries like ours, where there are different levels of government, the constitution clearly lays down the powers of different levels of government. This is what they did in Belgium, but was refused in Sri Lanka. This is called federal division of power.</p>
                            <p>The same principle can be extended to levels of government lower than the State government, such as the municipality and panchayat. Let us call division of powers involving higher and lower levels of government vertical division of power. We shall study these at some length in the next chapter.</p>

                            <p>Power may also be shared among different social groups, such as the religious and linguistic groups. 'Community government' in Belgium is a good example of this arrangement. In some countries, there are constitutional and legal arrangements, whereby socially weaker sections and women are represented in the legislatures and administration.</p>
                            <p>Last year, we studied the system of 'reserved constituencies' in assemblies and the parliament of our country. This type of arrangement is meant to give space in the government and administration to diverse social groups, who otherwise, would feel alienated from the government. This method is used to give minority communities a fair share in power. In Unit II, we shall look at various ways of accommodating social diversities.</p>

                            <p>Power sharing arrangements can also be seen in the way political parties, pressure groups and movements control or influence those in power. In a democracy, the citizens must have freedom to choose among various contenders for power. In contemporary democracies, this takes the form of competition among different parties. Such competition ensures that power does not remain in one hand.</p>
                            <p>In the long run, power is shared among different political parties that represent different ideologies and social groups. Sometimes this kind of sharing can be direct, when two or more parties form an alliance to contest elections. If their alliance is elected, they form a coalition government and thus share power.</p>
                            <p>In a democracy, we find interest groups, such as those of traders, businessmen, industrialists, farmers and industrial workers. They also will have a share in governmental power, either through participation in governmental committees or bringing influence on the decision-making process. In Unit III, we shall study the working of political parties.</p>

                                    <p>"We need to give more power to the panchayats to realise the dream of Mahatma Gandhi and the hopes of the makers of our Constitution. Panchayati Raj establishes true democracy. It restores power to the only place where power belongs in a democracy ‚Äì in the hands of the people. Giving power to Panchayats is also a way to reduce corruption and increase administrative efficiency. When people participate in the planning and implementation of developmental schemes, they would naturally exercise greater control over these schemes. This would eliminate the corrupt middlemen. Thus, Panchayati Raj will strengthen the foundations of our democracy."</p>
